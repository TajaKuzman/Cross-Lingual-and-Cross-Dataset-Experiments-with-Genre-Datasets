"DOG - A CREATURE FOR THE LONELY? <p/> Living with an animal is good for the body and soul. Children who are lucky enough to grow up around animals develop more feeling (empathy) for others, the ability to accept the differences between living things, their communication is fuller (it is easier for them to perceive correctly something besides words). They also have fewer allergies and express their emotions more easily. <p/> The above is said in an uiber simple way, in a homey way, a la Nina (jest). But it is an officially recognised fact that. So I did not make it up. <p/> I can tell you from my own experience in therapy with a dog (I don't have many, but I have a few) that children really do sometimes - when they have problems with this - open up more easily to a dog than to a human. Why? Because the dog does not judge. For him you are great when you are sad and when you are happy. It doesn't take your sadness or disappointment as an attack on its personality. So it accepts who you are. And it tries to improve your mood. Even when he is the cause of your disappointment, he doesn't take it out on his own resentment or hurt, but approaches it in a constructive way, trying to make amends in any way he can. It's funny for me to think like that... Funny that a higher evolved being, i.e. a human being, has to learn this extra many times, but a dog is just given it. So, on that point, I say calmly (and I don't mind if someone jumps in the loft about it)... Well, I will say that in some cases, at this point, the dog is more advanced than the human in terms of social skills. In some cases. I just find insensitivity to another's pain an extremely frightening trait. <p/> I have often heard the statement: lonely people have dogs. I always come to two conclusions from this statement, whether it is written or spoken and in what context: <p/> it reflects a person who thinks that he is an extra good soul just because he sometimes gets involved with someone. He does not know that this is not dictated by his character, but by the fact that he is born a social being. There are many ways to be involved with anyone. Roughly in 2 ways: bad or good. If I (magari with the help of animals) had conquered the good, I would know that this statement dilutes by negativity something that does not even need a negative connotation. If you like flowers, you like flowers, if you like animals, you like animals. If you like them, they are not superfluous. Just as simple as that. There is no need for pejorative approaches and words that can only bring pain when a person is belittled and nothing else. To me, that is hypocritical. A lack of understanding of acceptance of other living beings, garnished with the cellophane of (supposedly) trying to understand. A person with feeling for others would not express it that way. He would have benefited from the example of canine companionship. But I am glad he does not. Because it's not the dog's fault. He is not a doormat, he is a living being. <p/> Of course, a dog is a wonderful companion. Among other things because, as I said above, he knows how to coexist. Calm souls show emotions and moods in a relaxed way. We humans are not always and everywhere good at that. When we grow up, we are... well, less uninhibitedly genuine. He is also a wonderful listener and as a rule does not give away secrets. Intermezzo: those who know their animals, or animals in general, well know that they also tell some secrets. Just not, as a rule, in such an extreme way as the currently still famous bullmastiffs. Such expressions are maddeningly rare, because very few animals are so totally nerved - destroyed. I, for example, years ago, denounced my landlord for charging around the flat when I was not at home because of animals. Because I know my animals. In a humiliated confession, he then asked me - how did you know, since I hadn't moved anything? But there is no substitute for human closeness. That goes both ways, of course. No human being can replace a dog's closeness either. And the fact is that the dog as a companion really helps the desperate... because it gets them out, with people! ! ! Not because it replaces them. Because it cheers them up and brings them back to sociability. All this, of course, does not mean that all dog owners are the same. Hello? Are all parents the same? All rugby players? All at the same school? The important thing to say here is that the overly desperate don't snog the dog anyway. Fact. And that like-minded people walking their dogs is no worse than like-minded people playing volleyball.",Opinion/Argumentation
"Partition walls <p/> It often happens that when building a new residential building, we overlook a flaw in the construction plan or a wall cannot be built as planned. In such cases, partition walls can be the solution. They are also often used in commercial premises to enclose individual employees and give them a little privacy in their own little ""office"". They are a quick and inexpensive solution. They achieve good acoustic and thermal performance. <p/> Partition walls are constructed with a substructure, which can be wood or metal, on which plasterboard panels are installed. There are a large number of plasterboard suppliers that also offer water-resistant plasterboards. Such panels are used for bathrooms and other wet areas. For better strength, the wall should be covered with one to three layers of plasterboard. Stone wool is inserted into the substructure to provide better insulation. All plumbing and electrical installations can also be installed in the partition walls without being visible from the outside. Installing a partition is a completely dry job, which can be done even when the building is occupied. We can also install in partition walls anything we install in normal brickwork. So, with the right substructure, doors, cabinets, speakers and lights can also be built into the partition.",Promotion

"Frames for your posters <p/> There are a few things to keep in mind when ordering poster frames. We also need to consider where the frames and posters will be placed. If it is a marketing poster that will be installed outside, you need to be aware that it will be exposed to the weather. It is wise in this case to purchase waterproof frames so that the first storm does not destroy the posters, because in this case our efforts would be for nothing. The easiest way to find quality poster frames is online, as there are many quality manufacturers (3d art). Of course, it is always best to choose one where you can see at first glance a good price/quality ratio. Frames also differ in a few other ways, mainly in terms of where they will be hung. So you can choose from shop window frames, wall frames, hanging frames and, wouldn't you believe it, car frames. In fact, larger vehicles can be fitted with frames designed for marketing posters. Not only are frames made in traditional sizes, but you can also adjust the size of the frames to suit your needs and your poster format. Nowadays, it is well known that designers love to be creative and for creative posters you will also need creative frames. It is for the latter that some companies specialising in the production of marketing accessories will be able to help you and provide you with what you expect at the best prices. You should also consider that the frames will be functional and that you will be able to easily change the posters on display.",Instruction

"JUDGMENT: The rule in Article 216 of the CCP allows the court (after the evidentiary proceedings) in the fact-finding proceedings to give a quantitative (numerical) estimate of the quantity given (claimed) (money or substitute items), of which it has only a qualitative idea on the basis of the evidence given. However, the court's discretion in question is not a substitute for the litigant's duty to gather the procedural material and does not relieve the party of the obligation to plead all the facts and to adduce the evidence on which it bases its claims (judgment and order of the Supreme Court, Op. No II Ips 250/2005 of 11.5.2006). <p/> CONCLUSION: The revision is dismissed. <The costs of the audit shall be borne by the auditee. <p/> SUMMARY: (1) The sums claimed in the application relate to the payment of the insurance premium (SIT 62,155,660.00) and to compensation for the damage allegedly suffered by the applicant as a result of the non-payment of the insurance premium (SIT 61,516,094.55 and EUR 1,081,484.50 in tolar equivalent). On 31.5.1996 the parties concluded an insurance contract (the Contract) under Policy No 814552, which was governed by the defendant's 'General Conditions for the Insurance of Animals', the 'Special Conditions for the Insurance of Fish in the Sea' and the addendum to that policy. The latter provided for the escape of fish from the applicant's cages as a result of a wind of the eighth degree of force on the Beaufort scale (gale) as an insured event. On 5 August 1997 the applicant reported the escape of 224 684 perch and sea bass. The Court of First Instance found that a storm had indeed raged between 25 and 27 December 1996, but held that the applicant had not proved that the number of fish allegedly escaped from its farm (from the cages on Platform III) as a result. <p/> (2) The Court of First Instance dismissed all the claims in their entirety. The Court of Second Instance dismissed the applicant's appeal against that judgment and, upholding all its findings of fact and conclusions of law, affirmed it. <p/> (3) The applicant challenges the judgment of the Court of First Instance in its entirety by way of revision. In it, he relies on ""all the grounds of review"" referred to in Article 370(2)(1), (2) and (3) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A.). The Court of First Instance is asked to uphold the review and to alter the judgment of the Court of First Instance by granting the claims in the action or, in the alternative, to set aside the judgments of the Courts of First Instance and Second Instance and to refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. <p/> (4) The review was served on the defendant, who did not reply, and on the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia. <p/> (5) The applicant was removed from the court register after all procedural steps in the review proceedings had been completed, with the exception of the issuance of the judicial decision. This act, which is a procedural act of the court, is not affected by the stay of the proceedings on the basis of the law itself (Article 205(1)(3) of the CPC), as the second sentence of Article 207(2) of the CPC is applied mutatis mutandis (thus the Supreme Court's judgment of 19.12.2006 in Case No III Ips 42/2006 as an expression of settled case-law). <p/> The revision is not justified. <p/> (6) The revision criticises the judgment of the court of second instance for a fundamental infringement of the provisions of the procedure referred to in Article 339(2)(14) of the Civil Procedure Code. It considers the infringement to be, in general terms, that the (contested) judgment of the court of second instance ""stated, contrary to the documentary evidence, some findings which contradict itself and which contradict the content of the documents or records of the depositions in the proceedings"". This is reflected, first, in the Court of First Instance's finding that, although the applicant, when reporting the damage on 30.12.1996, stated that 'a certain number of fish had also escaped', this nevertheless did not constitute a notification under policy No 8, but rather a notification of damage to the platform for a quarry on the platform. However, in order to satisfy the alleged ground of review, the judgment under appeal would have to be so defective as to preclude its review. That is not the case. The judgment under appeal is, in that respect (the last paragraph of the second page and the first paragraph of the third page of the grounds of appeal), capable of being reviewed: it is in agreement with the Court of First Instance, which itself gave full reasons (the last paragraph of the third page of the grounds of appeal).  <p/> (7) It is also possible to review the judgment under appeal (while the plea in law relied on is not raised) in so far as the auditor criticises it for contradicting the view that the plaintiff was late in declaring the escape of the fish in the light of the Contract and the provision of section 917(1) of the Law on Contractual Relations (LCCR) in force at the time, and the view that it did not forfeit its right to the benefit of the Contract as a result.  147 of the case-file) can be read without difficulty as meaning that the circumstances of the applicant's notification of the insured event - which was unusually (and unlawfully! ) late in the light of the care which the applicant, as a professional fish-farmer, should have been expected to exercise, and in the light of the applicant's established capacity to detect a significant decline in the number of fish (a 53 % escape of the insured population) - were taken into account by the court only in the context of its assessment of the evidence. The applicant did not (contrary to Article 918 of the Civil Code) lose its right to the sum insured by reason of the delay in informing the defendant, but its claims were dismissed on the ground that it had failed to prove the occurrence of the harmful event. <p/> (8) Finally, the judgment under appeal is reviewable even if the alleged illogicality between the assessment of the credibility of the farm workers who testified that the nets were blown down by the storm and the fish swam outside them and the evidentiary assessment that the plaintiff failed to prove the occurrence of the insured event were true. The assessment of the credibility of the workers in question is only part of the assessment of the evidence, which, however, was also assessed by the Court of Appeal on this point, with clear reasons (see the second paragraph of the third page of the reasoning). The substance of that evidential assessment itself, which is disputed by the auditor, on the ground that Platform I was completely destroyed in the storm, making it untenable to conclude that the fish did not escape from the nearby Platform III, is, as a question of fact, outside the scope of the review (Article 370(3) C.C.P.P.) <p/> (9) The substantive legal position of the Courts of Second Instance and First Instance, that the burden of proof of the occurrence of the insured event was on the claimant, is correct. It is not the case, as the Reviser submits, that the courts of second and first instance insisted that the claimant prove the escape of exactly 224 684 fish (see the third paragraph on page three of the judgment of the court of second instance). Their exact number could, in cases such as the present one, be determined (for the purposes of the litigation) by means of Article 216 of the CCP, but under conditions which are not met in the present case. <p/> (10) The rule in Article 216 of the CCP allows the court (after the evidentiary proceedings) in the fact-finding proceedings to give a quantitative (numerical) estimate of the quantity given (claimed in the action) (money or substitute goods) of which it has only a qualitative idea on the basis of the evidence adduced. That Article expressly provides that the court may do so if the amount of the sum claimed or of the replacement goods is either not ascertainable without disproportionate difficulty or not ascertainable at all. Neither of these (necessary, not sufficient) conditions is present in the present case. The court's discretion in question is not a substitute for the litigant's duty to gather procedural material and does not relieve a party of the duty to plead all the facts and propose evidence on which it bases its claims (Supreme Court judgment and order, Op. No II Ips 250/2005 of 11 May 2006). Since the procedural material gathered in the present case does not substantiate the assessment that any fish escaped as a result of the storm at all, the discretion of Article 216 of the Civil Procedure Code is inapplicable. The courts of first and second instance were therefore correct in finding against the applicant on the basis of the burden of proof. <p/> (11) In so doing, the Supreme Court has responded to the revisionist submissions, which are of decisive importance. Since the grounds relied on did not prove to be well-founded and since it did not otherwise find that the substantive law had been erroneously applied, it dismissed the revision as unfounded on the basis of Article 378 of the CPC. <p/> (12) The decision on the costs of the review is based on Article 165(1) of the CPC in conjunction with Article 154(1) of the CPC. The applicant is to bear its own costs.",Legal/Regulation

"What do you need to know about sunglasses? <p/> Choose sunglasses that look great and protect your eyes at the same time... <p/> The wide range of sunglasses in all styles, prices and characteristics can make it difficult to decide which pair of sunglasses is best for you. Finding a pair of sunglasses you like may be easier if you read now about what to look out for and what types of sunglasses are out there. What should you look for in a pair of sunglasses? Three important things: quality eye protection, comfort and fantastic style. <p/> Put UV protection on the list of characteristics you look for in sunglasses <p/> Your sunglasses should offer protection against ultraviolet radiation, a component of the sun that increases the chance of sun damage. The FDA, the government agency that oversees the manufacture and sale of sunglasses in the US, recommends that you look for sunglasses with lenses that block 99-100% of UVA and UVB radiation. The label should say either UV 400 or 100% UV protection. <p/> Lens materials in sunglasses The difference between the lens materials on sunglasses is quite small. Some surfaces are harder than others, some types are more durable. Three materials are most commonly used for sunglass lenses: - polycarbonate; long-lasting lightweight plastic. - CR-39; a plastic usually used in lenses of a prescribed quality. - Glass; durable or much heavier to wear. <p/> Sunglass lens colour and other layers <p/> UV filter is one of the layers that make up the lenses of sunglasses, but there are many others besides. <p/> Sunglass lens colour The colour of the lenses serves to absorb the light that passes through them. The colour you choose is a matter of personal taste, but you should take into account a few important features related to the colour of the lenses. - The grey colour of the lenses reduces the amount of light and at the same time does not distort the colours. - Brown and amber reduce glare, including the glare created by the blue frequency in the Sun, which can make objects look hazy. Brown and amber lenses distort colours more than grey. - Yellow lenses reduce the blur caused by blue light better than brown, sharpening vision but causing colour distortion. <p/> - Green tints in lenses reduce glare and help filter out some blue light. They offer good contrast between objects. - Pink lenses might be a good choice if you participate in water sports or other outdoor activities, as they offer good contrast between objects on a blue or green background. <p/> Sunglasses with polarised lenses The polarised layer on the lenses reduces the glare that occurs when light is reflected off certain objects such as water, asphalt and other similar surfaces. Polarised lenses are recommended, but the choice is still yours. <p/> Make sure your glasses have scratch protection A thin layer can be applied to the lenses to make them more scratch resistant. Plastic lenses scratch more easily than glass lenses. <p/> Sunglasses with mirrored lenses <p/> Some sunglasses have a mirrored surface on the outside of the lens. Although they are very popular, scratches can appear on them very quickly. <p/> Sunglasses with photochromic lenses Photochromic (or photosensitive) lenses become darker when exposed to UV radiation. The change happens quickly when you swap the darker surroundings for a lighter one. <p/> Sunglasses with an anti-reflective layer An anti-reflective layer reduces the reflection of light hitting the back of the lens, thereby protecting the rays from reflecting into the eyes. <p/> Sunglasses frame shapes <p/> Sunglasses frames are made from plastic, base metals, titanium, aluminium and many other materials. You should try different types of frames to get a feel for their weight and decide which ones suit you best. <p/> Children also need sunglasses When buying sunglasses for children, be aware that children also need protection against UV rays and glare. Forget those little toy sunglasses; buy something that will really protect your child's eyes. <p/> Sunglasses with extra eye protection - The lenses of custom-made sunglasses keep out more light and UV radiation than ordinary lenses. - Wear a hat for more protection against the sun. This will help keep your skin looking young and healthy. Experts say that the less we squint, the fewer wrinkles we have. <p/> Choose sunglasses that suit your style Sunglasses styles change every year, just like any other fashion, but there's such a wide range that no pair of glasses can go out of style. And sunglasses don't have to be expensive to be effective, so you don't need to buy a whole new collection. Designer and specialised sunglasses have a higher price tag than most other glasses, apart from those used for sports, but you can find all kinds of modern eyewear at affordable and accessible prices. It is just important to look out for the UV label. If you already know what frame shape suits you best, go to the store and try on different styles of glasses. If you get permission, you can also take them for a walk outside to see how the glasses actually perform in practice. <p/> News",Instruction

"Rayo Vallecano 2-3 Real Madrid <p/> Real Madrid won three more points at the Vallecas Stadium in a match in which they were already 0-3 up, but then things got complicated when Rayo Vallecano reduced the score from two 11th-minute penalty corners in just two minutes. Cristiano Ronaldo put Real Madrid in front in the third minute after a brilliant solo effort, and Benzema then extended the advantage in the first half when he scored with a header. The second half started in the same way as the first, with Ronaldo, the current top scorer in La Liga, hitting the net again after just four minutes of play. As with Benzema's goal, Bale was the assistant for Ronaldo's second goal, adding two more assists to his tally against Sevilla. After Real's third goal, however, everything turned upside down for Real, as the hosts had two penalty corners in just two minutes, both of which were successfully converted by Viera. Real Madrid then regained control of the game and successfully brought the match to a close, with the players already starting to think about Tuesday's game against Juventus. <p/> Real Madrid visited the Vallecas stadium with fresh memories of the big win against Sevilla three days ago at the Bernabeu and the good second half performance at the Camp Nou the week before.

Already in the third minute, when Cristiano Ronaldo launched a counter-attack, he passed it to Luka Modric, who gave the ball back to him with a beautiful pass, and then Cristiano Ronaldo first played brilliantly between the legs of the last defender Rayo, and in the final minute, face-to-face, he coolly matted the home goalkeeper Martinez with a shot into the bottom far corner to put Real in the lead. A super goal from the Portuguese, showing how in great shape he and Carlo Ancelotti's team are. Real doubled their advantage in the 31st minute when Karim Benzema headed home after a precise cross from the right by Gareth Bale. It was the Welshman's third assist in the last two games and the Frenchman's third goal in four days. The visitors gave the home side a real lesson in finishing, although the Whites could have gone further ahead after the first half after Real had two more good chances. Cristiano Ronaldo tried a volley in the 44th minute after a pass from Di Maria but his shot went wide of the post, while Carvajal's header was also just missed by inches by the Ruben goalkeeper. <p/> The second half, in which Illarra replaced Xabi Alonso, who is making his comeback from a long-term injury, continued in the same way as the first, with a Real Madrid goal. In the fourth minute of the second half, Bale was at it again, winning the ball on the right, breaking into the middle and passing to Ronaldo, who scored his second goal of the game to make it 3-0. It was Cristiano Ronaldo's 13th goal in La Liga this season, making him the top scorer in the Spanish championship. After a big lead for Carlo Ancelotti's charges, everything looked like a peaceful ending, but the hosts came completely close just two minutes apart. After clumsy interventions from Pepe and Marcelo, head referee Alfonso Alvarez Iquierdo twice pointed to the harshest penalty. Jonathan Viera was the better of the two in his duel with goalkeeper Diego Lopez. The home team gained confidence after scoring twice, and it was Diego Lopez who had to prove his worth in the 65th minute when he masterfully stopped a shot by Alberto Bueno. The hosts chased the equaliser until the end of the match, and on the other side Real had a couple of chances to score their fourth goal of the game, including two more attempts from Ronaldo that were saved by the Raya goalkeeper, but the score remained 2-3 and Real's ninth victory in the Spanish championship this season.",News

"Front page / Current / Columns / Column: If fish could talk <p/> 08.02.2021 <p/> COLUMN DZZŽ NOVO MESTO <p/> Last month I discussed children's desire for an animal friend and how sometimes parents recklessly choose an animal to please their child. In the meantime, I also touched on goldfish in passing, which reminded me that fish actually deserve a column of their own. They are animals that are often misunderstood, inadequately treated and poorly cared for. <p/> Although most people think otherwise, fish also feel pain and fear. In fact, they are quite complex creatures that experience the world in much the same way as we do. This means that we need to arrange their environment in a way that keeps them relaxed and healthy. But what kind of environment is suitable for fish? <p/> This question creates an ""Emmental effect"" - more cheese, more holes, i.e. it offers more new questions than answers. Aquaristics is a rather complex and very large field and it is impossible to answer such a question in a few short sentences. Therefore, this article is by no means an aquarist's handbook, but only a cursory attempt to encourage you to take a responsible approach to aquaristics. <p/> It is actually a matter of imitating as closely as possible the environment in which a particular species of fish is found in the wild. So, before setting up a new aquarium, we need to consider the needs of a particular organism or choose a species that we can make comfortable in our aquarium. So what are the characteristics of a 'good' aquarium? <p/> First and foremost, the aquarium must be the right shape and size. Here I can mention goldfish, which are a textbook example of aquatic organisms that are most often found in a totally inappropriate environment. The goldfish, Carassius auratus auratus, originates from China, grows as large as 30-40 cm, and is a schooling fish, which means that we need to stock at least 5-10 specimens in total. It logically follows that these fish are only suitable for large, outdoor ponds and that there are not many that can be suitably housed in an aquarium in an apartment. I should add that they have a very long life span, living for several decades, and they are also very intelligent and can be taught tricks. If they could talk, what would all those poor little goldfish crammed into too small containers have to say? Of course, it is understandable that we do not have unlimited space for huge aquariums at home, and there is nothing wrong with that. In this case, however, we simply have to choose a species of fish that is comfortable in a smaller aquarium. <p/> Water properties are also very important. Water can be hard or soft, basic or acidic. Hard water is water in which a lot of minerals are dissolved. Tap water in Slovenia is often quite hard (have you noticed how quickly limescale builds up in the bathroom?), but a large proportion of ornamental aquarium fish are soft-water fish - in nature they live in waters with few dissolved minerals. If a fish is living in water that is not of a suitable quality (for example, a soft-water fish living in hard water, or water that is not of a good quality due to insufficient filtration), this is stressful for the fish. Prolonged presence of stress hormones leads to failure of internal organs and metabolism. One example of a fish that most people are familiar with, at least in appearance, and which is often stocked in unsuitable aquariums is the Siamese fighting fish, the betta. This type of fish needs very soft, slightly acidic water and lots of the right plants, so water from our taps is not usually suitable for them. Before we introduce organisms, we need to check the parameters of our water and adapt it to the needs of our aquatic sub-tenants, or rather, choose ones that can live in the water we have. <p/> Another very important thing for any healthy aquarium is a biologically stable filter. Filtration in an aquarium is not as simple as most people imagine. It is not just a matter of dirt particles getting stuck in the filter material and then being washed off. Filtration must also, and above all, be biological, which means that the filter and other surfaces in the aquarium are inhabited by beneficial bacteria that break down food debris, fish poo and plant debris, thus improving water quality. This filtration does not happen overnight, of course, and the bacteria need time to multiply sufficiently. From the first day we start the aquarium, it will be at least two weeks or more before it is stable enough for fish to settle in. Changes in the water parameters should be monitored regularly (with tests for nitrite, nitrate, ammonia). The values will first rise and then fall back - at that point the aquarium is established, or as aquarists put it - sciklan. <p/> In addition to the above, the choice of decoration, plants and combinations of organisms that can coexist together is also important. Of course, plastics are largely avoided in favour of natural materials (wood, stone), but which ones and how much depends on the individual fish species. The right plants are also an important part of a healthy aquarium and it is generally recommended to keep the aquarium as overgrown as possible (except, of course, when you have fish that also live in a plant-free environment in the wild). Often, aquariums are decorated with boats, treasure chests, castles and similar kitsch, which, of course, have nothing to do with the fish and their natural environment. <p/> Like all other animals, we have a duty to look after fish and other aquatic organisms in a way that makes them feel good. This is not only a moral but also a legal duty for all animal owners. Unfortunately, our wishes and aesthetics are last on the list of priorities when it comes to aquarium design. If we cannot accept this fact, then we can consider another hobby. Let's ask ourselves what the fish would tell us if they could talk. <p/> Anyone interested in learning more about aquaristics, aquatic organisms, choosing and setting up an aquarium can find a lot of useful information online, for example on the Alfa in betta blog, and in various Facebook groups, such as Aquarstika Slovenia - Bojan Dolenc.",Opinion/Argumentation

The visitors were the better and more aggressive opponents in the first part of the game, which they managed to build on with a goal by Peterka in the 27th minute and thus went into the break with a one-goal advantage. In the second half, they took a 0:2 lead in the 50th minute on a goal by Turha, but Radomlans had a ready answer.

"Responsibility, in my view, should not only mean that they can (or even should) make decisions for the child, but above all that their decisions should be responsible, sensible and beneficial for the child's development. Also in the SSKJ, responsibility is defined (among other things) as a quality, a characteristic of that which, because of its importance, its consequences, requires great knowledge, care, and as an attitude in which someone has to give an explanation, a justification for their work, their actions Responsibility is therefore given to someone because it is assumed that they have the knowledge and the ability to do the ""right"" thing with the thing, the task, entrusted to them. The power that parents are given is not supposed to be given in itself, but because they know how to make better choices. Such responsibility is undoubtedly stressful for a parent. After all, most parents want the best for their children, but it is difficult for them to know what is really best for the child. So my mother wanted more dolls when she was a child and now she is stocking her daughter with dolls so that she does not feel frustrated. What may not be realised is that her daughter does not like dolls at all. <p/> The decision-making power that comes as a package with parental responsibility often grates on the nerves of various experts. Parents can decide whether to allow the school doctor to carry out a systematic check-up with the school doctor at all. Parents can decide whether or not their child can see the school counsellor (the exception, of course, is acute situations that need to be dealt with immediately - e.g. fights between children, extreme abuse of classmates or teachers, disruption of classes). Parents decide whether or not the doctor can treat their child. Parents decide whether or not the child can see a psychologist. All this power is great, of course, as long as parents really work with it in the child's best interests. But, unfortunately, this often does not seem to be the case. <p/> At school, for example, the child is highly socially anxious, unself-conscious, unaccepted by his classmates, and often finds it difficult to come to school. Teachers notice this problem and find it most useful to have the child see a school counsellor to develop social competences, to try to develop a better self-image. But the parents say no. Our child is not like that already. But at home he is normally talkative. The school has nothing to interfere in our family. <p/> Similar situation. At the age of three, the entire population of children in Slovenia undergoes a systematic psychological examination. This screening identifies both children who show mental disorders and children who are at high risk of developing neurotic disorders or maladjustment. Of course, not all children identified as being at risk will necessarily develop disorders. But the results of this screening have fairly good predictive validity. The prediction that the developmental trajectory of children identified as at-risk will be towards a neurotic structure is therefore true with a high probability. The psychologist therefore identifies a child as being at risk and suggests a form of follow-up treatment. If the parents do not want this treatment, it will not be given. And a child whose adverse developmental course could be reversed at the age of three may be a behaviourally problematic toddler at the age of ten, getting on the nerves of his parents and even more so of the school. Perhaps, of course, it is not necessarily nothing. But it is better to work preventively on a larger number of children than to have to take curative action when it is actually too late. And if someone has to finish his personality development later as an adult with a psychotherapist, this development will take somewhere around twice as long as it would have taken if it had been carried out normally in childhood. <p/> Parents thus have almost godlike powers over their children's development, and the various experts can only oppose them when the parents are very clearly endangering the child's health or life. The latter is difficult to prove, especially when the threat is not physical but psychological. And practically impossible when it comes to matters such as potentially risky personal development, which is ultimately only potential.",Opinion/Argumentation

"News <p/> Smashing coconuts to get your rights <p/> Professional footballers in Poland have come up with an ingenious idea to fight for their rights after some clubs started bullying them and forcing them to train on their own due to their disagreement with the terms of their new contracts and their subsequent refusal to sign them.

As part of a campaign launched by the Polish Professional Footballers' Union PZP to mark these events, players from the second division club Olimpia Grudziaz gathered in the changing room and shouted 'let's smash the coconut' in one voice, which was then smashed with a hammer a few moments later. Lukasz Surma, who has more than 500 appearances in the Polish first league, joined the second division players on the occasion. Here you can watch a video of the players smashing coconuts in protest. <p/> Other news",News
"Telekom's General Meeting today on a special audit of certain transactions <p/> At today's General Meeting in Ljubljana, Telekom Slovenije shareholders will decide, among other things, on a proposal by Kada and Soda for a special auditor to examine the management of Telekom Slovenije's individual transactions over the last five years. This is the time when the company was managed by both the former CEO Bojan Dremelj and the current CEO Ivica Kranjčević. <p/> Kapitalska družba (Kad) and Slovenska odškodninska družba (Sod), which together own a fifth of Telekom, are demanding an investigation into Telekom's acquisitions in Slovenia and abroad, real estate purchases and sales, and major investments, among other things. The auditors are to assess, among other things, whether the transactions were economically justified, transparent and secured, and how they affect the company in terms of risk exposure. <p/> Last July, the company's Supervisory Board instructed Kranjčević's team to initiate appropriate legal proceedings against the former Telekom management regarding their liability. The audit report on the acquisitions in Macedonia and Najdi.si identified a number of shortcomings. <p/> The former management of Telekom Slovenije, headed by Dremlje, supports the proposal for a special audit, stressing that it acted diligently, but the current management says that it understands this request as an interest in a more in-depth examination of certain transactions, or an examination of the management of these transactions over the last five years, and certainly not as a vote of no confidence in the current management, which took office barely a year ago. <p/> In addition, the General Meeting will decide on the authorisation to purchase own shares, following a request in January from shareholders representing 5.82% of the company's share capital. The shareholders are NFD, Kapitalska družba, Perspektiva FT, NLB, Primorski fondi and Zavarovalnica Triglav. (STA)",News
"We are a vocal group of twelve female folk singers, united by an immense joy for singing folk songs and a desire to present the diversity of singing traditions in Slovenia. Singing brings us closer together, gives us strength and at the same time strengthens our friendship, forged in our student days, when we were dancers of AFS France Marolt and KUD Tina Rožanc. Today we are doctors, nurses, psychologists, biologists, engineers, lawyers... <p/> We started our activity in 2003, and the group has been officially active as a company since 2006. The artistic director of the singing group Cintare is Mrs. Mira Nastran. <p/> The singers took their name from a healing flower - the Tawny Rose, also popularly called CINTARA (Centaurium erythraea). The message of its healing power goes back far into the past and has been passed on from generation to generation, just like the traditions of folk songs. <p/> Cintara sings original folk songs from all regions of Slovenia, as well as songs of Slovenians living beyond our borders. After three years of activity, our singing programme includes over fifty folk songs and we have given a number of performances at home and abroad. <p/> In addition to performances for our target audience, Cintara also takes part in charity events, where our singing cheers up patients in hospitals and the elderly in homes, and in our own way, as a Taventrose, helps people to heal their souls and bodies.",Information/Explanation

"Marko Košir FROM THE IRON ROAD TO... The railway in philately, art, music, film, etc. published 24 May 2010 This book shows the influence of the railway on the things people do for pleasure and for a short time. Sometimes it is also a way for some people to earn a living and make our lives better. <p/> Chapter 1 gives a brief history of stamps with railway motifs. This is followed by images of stamps from Europe and the rest of the world. The stamps of the former Yugoslavia and Slovenian stamps after 1991 are presented in detail. All the locomotives on the stamps are additionally described, and I have added to the stamps their philatelic and catalogue value. Special mention is made of some of the steam locomotives of the Slovenian Railways (SŽ) and the Ocean locomotive, with an account of important events in Maribor during the construction of the Vienna-Trieste line. The chapter concludes with a selection of some famous steam locomotives of my choice. <p/> Chapter 2, after a brief introduction, presents in detail Honegger's composition Pacific 231. The composition is interesting because its origin is linked to a mistake made by the composer. This is followed by a short presentation of some of the Pacific series locomotives from France and the rest of the world. <p/> The third chapter shows the link between railways and poetry, or rather the influence of railways on the creation of 'railway' poems. The poems selected are Prešeren's On the Railway Road and Župančič's By Train. This is followed by a description of the locomotives that may have pulled the train that Župančič rode through Gorenjska on his way to Paris. Here again, the content of Župančič's poem does not correspond to the situation on the railway at the time of its composition in 1905. <p/> The chapter on railways and painting, after an introduction showing some famous paintings of railways, is dedicated to the pioneer of the expert treatment of the history of railways in Slovenia and the man most responsible for the establishment of the museum collection and the Railway Museum in Ljubljana. This is the academic painter Stane Kumar. It also describes where overconfidence in oneself, underestimating others and ignoring historical and professional facts in the name of artistic freedom can lead. This is exactly what happened to Stane Kumar. <p/> The last chapter describes the Bohinj railway, its history, important buildings, the landscape and people along it, and two famous locomotives from the past. <p/> An appendix explains some of the philatelic and railway terms that appear in the book. The wheel arrangements of steam locomotives from all over the world are thoroughly explained. A schematic of a steam locomotive and a data table of all the locomotives in the book are also added. In addition to the basic data, the table contains detailed information for those who are more familiar with the subject. (From the author's preface.) <p/> Brief introduction of the author.

"Photovoltaics have regained momentum in Slovenia in recent years, as the construction of solar power plants for self-supply is on the rise. This means that we generate electricity solely for our own needs, and any surplus cannot be sold to distribution. The main principle of a solar power plant is to convert solar energy into electricity, and it does this using solar cells, which are the basic building blocks of photovoltaic modules. <p/> From an ecological point of view, a PV power plant is considered clean and environmentally friendly, as it does not produce any greenhouse or other gas emissions. Solar energy is the third most important source of renewable energy in terms of capacity, after hydro and wind power. More than 100 countries around the world use solar energy. Photovoltaics can be installed on the ground or mounted on the roof or walls of a building. <p/> In a solar power plant, the electromagnetic waves of the Sun are converted into direct current and voltage. The conversion process is completely inaudible, safe, reliable and environmentally friendly, and takes place in diffuse sunlight. Photovoltaics or photovoltaic systems can operate for many years and require little maintenance or intervention after their initial installation, so that after the initial investment costs, the operating costs of a PV power plant are very low compared to existing electricity generation technologies. <p/> What is PV - the PV module at the heart of the PV plant <p/> At the heart of any solar power plant or PV system (even for own use) are the photovoltaic modules, which are the generator of the solar power plant. Of course, the arrays, the mounting structure, the shielding and the metering point are also a necessary part of any solar power plant. <p/> A photovoltaic power plant consists of two sets of basic elements. The first is the photovoltaic modules, which are the heart of the solar power plant and play the role of converting the electromagnetic waves of the sun into direct current and voltage. The second set consists of the power elements, which serve to use the electricity generated for specific purposes. These include: rectifiers, supporting structure, connecting cables, DC and AC couplings, regulators, batteries, switching and protection devices and other installation materials. <p/> A PV module consists of identical solar cells connected in series. Depending on the types of solar cells installed, the PV cells (or modules) can be made of crystalline cells (polycrystalline and monocrystalline modules) or amorphous silicon. A module consists of a number of solar cells in series (between 36 and 72 pieces/module), which are sandwiched between a toughened glass surface and a special EVA film. The edges of the so-called sandwich construction are then sealed with aluminium foil and a connection dock is mounted on the back of the module. The whole is then framed in an aluminium frame. <p/> Photovoltaics are virtually maintenance-free and operate extremely reliably. The regular maintenance that is required is to clean the surface of the modules once a year in case of major dust or dirt, and in the case of a stand-alone PV installation at home (for own use), we make sure that the surroundings are maintained and cleaned in case of overgrowth. <p/> Photovoltaic power plant - installation requires thoughtful planning <p/> The basic requirement for the installation of photovoltaics is a sunny, shade-free area. However, many of the challenges regarding the orientation of the building, its position and the pitch of the roof can be solved with module supports. The PV panels shall preferably be mounted on the sunny south side of the roof, or elsewhere if the south side is not possible, at an angle of 32 degrees. Deviating from the optimum angle by, for example, 20 degrees reduces the efficiency by about 5 %, while deviating from the southern direction to the east or west results in a loss of at least 15 %. Therefore, the deviation from the south direction should be as small as possible. The amount of solar radiation depends very much on the broad and narrow location of the building, and a lot on the time of year and the weather. In summer, the solar radiation is at a high angle - around 64 degrees, while in winter it is low - only below 16 degrees. Lower energy reflections, which require a larger solar cell area and a larger roof, must be taken into account, even in locations with lower solar radiation. These disadvantages, together with the intermittency and dependence on climatic conditions, must be taken into account in the design. The fact is that the higher the solar radiation, the higher the efficiency. In warmer places, solar radiation is much stronger, so the results are much more favourable. <p/> Self-use photovoltaics most often use the electricity generated to heat domestic water <p/> Self-use photovoltaics, consisting of only a few (two to five) modules, most often use the electricity generated to heat domestic water. The amount of electricity produced is quite low and you do not have to deal with the various paperwork that you have to do if you want to feed the energy produced into the grid. <p/> Larger or solar power plants, where the photovoltaics are made up of a larger number of modules, also produce a much larger amount of electricity. In this case, it is most worthwhile to get all the paperwork in order to obtain the right to feed the electricity into the grid. <p/> This option is sure to bring you the most profit, as the price of the green energy produced by a solar power plant is up to three times higher than that of conventional electricity. So if you were to use the energy produced in your household, the profit would be three times less than if you were to feed it into the grid. <p/>Solar energy is unlimited, clean and free. By using solar energy, we are also showing ourselves to be environmentally conscious. Welcome to Sol Navitas.",Information/Explanation
"News <p/> Archive <p/> Data protection with second-generation deduplication technology <p/> Monday 13 August 2012 <p/> Proper data protection is like an insurance policy. Most of the time it is not cashed in, but it is crucial if problems or damage actually occur. The cost of ""insurance"" in data protection is not only the cost of the equipment and its maintenance, but also the negative impact on business processes if, for example, archiving or restoring data takes too long, if data in remote locations of the company is not adequately protected, or if things are simply not regulated according to the law. <p/> As a direct response to these issues, technologies emerged a few years ago that have had a significant impact on improving archiving processes. In addition to the significant cheapening of hard disks, the development of data deduplication technology has been crucial. While the first generation of this technology brought some benefits to users, it was known even then that most of its potential still lay ahead. HP's deduplication development strategy was launched in 2010 and today the second generation of deduplication delivers improvements in areas such as performance, scalability and data management. StoreOne technology, as it is called, is based on a single deduplication algorithm developed in HP labs and runs on all HP hardware and software data protection solutions. In other words, deduplication technology can be implemented on the HP B6000, HP D2D2500 and HP D2D4000 series of products, and is fully supported by HP Data Protector archive software. A quick look at the main competitor, EMC, quickly reveals that its solutions are based on three mutually incompatible platforms (Data Domain, Avamar, Celerra) (Edison Group report, 2011), which is a stark difference to the single, unified architecture offered by HP.<p>Where does the shoe pinch the hardest when it comes to data protection? <p/> There is a general consensus that the following areas are particularly critical in relation to data protection, and that they weigh on users in one way or another: <p/> Time windows available for archiving <p/> The biggest challenge is to archive more and more data in less and less time. HP is responding to this with what it calls a ""scale-out"" architecture, which allows users to buy only the capacity and performance they really need, rather than having to buy both categories in stock. At the moment, HP's scale-up ends with 768 TB of gross capacity and an archiving speed of around 100 TB/hour. <p/> Data recovery after catastrophic events <p/> It is essential that data is stored in locations that allow it to be recovered in the event of a catastrophic event. There are a number of options for data replication over low bandwidth data links, as only deduplicated data travels between sites. StoreOnce technology allows data deduplication to happen wherever it is desired, either directly at the application or source where the data originates, at the archive server, or directly on the device where the data is stored. Deduplication can, of course, happen before the data is transferred from one location to another, so multiple copies of the same data can be archived in multiple locations at the same time. <p/> Protecting data in remote locations <p/> For companies that operate in multiple locations or even in multiple countries and continents, data is widely dispersed and often not sufficiently protected. With StoreOnce technology, data can be accessed or restored from a central location, no matter where it is. <p/> Data recovery capabilities <p/> Investing in archive solutions means nothing if data cannot be recovered in a reasonable time. Most vendors still focus mainly on archiving capacity, but forget about recovery and usually do not even publish this information to avoid embarrassment. HP's solutions are very much at the forefront here, offering speeds of up to 30 TB/hour, the highest among comparable solutions. <p/> StoreOnce Catalyst <p/> StoreOnce Catalyst (API toolset) is a new enhancement to archive solutions and allows deduplicated data to be moved directly from the archive application between StoreOnce systems, without the need to ""rehydrate"" it first, i.e. bring it back to a baseline state. StoreOnce Catalyst also allows replication of data from one location to multiple locations simultaneously and cascading of data between locations in a deduplicated format (leveraging narrow bandwidth connections). StoreOnce Catalyst technology is also integrated into HP Data Protector 7 software, making it particularly suitable for smaller businesses. <p/> Integration into your environment <p/> StoreOnce technology is widely supported (it is supported by a growing number of market-leading archiving software solutions), so you don't need to change archiving software if you don't want to, for example, when you buy a D2D2500 system. But if that's not a barrier, there are a number of good reasons why you should take a closer look at HP Data Protector. HP Data Protector uses the StoreOnce deduplication algorithm, which makes it easy to transfer deduplicated data to any StoreOnce hardware. <p/> 2. Data Protector supports contextual search of archived data, which means that data with specific content can be recovered, not just data with a specific naming convention (filename). This is made possible by the integrated ""Intelligent Data Operating Layer (IDOL)"" from Autonomy, which has been under HP's umbrella for some time. <p/> What about archiving to tape? <p/> For long-term data archiving, tape drives continue to be offered in a wide variety of configurations, as there is still a significant demand for them in the market. The fact is that long-term archiving to tape is still by far the cheapest option.",Promotion
"EVENING: A conversation with an ethical hacker <p/> 26 January 2015 Gregor Grosman, Večer <p/> Boštjan Špehonja is a hacker by profession, but he doesn't use his knowledge to cause harm, but offers it to companies for the benefit of discovering security holes and flaws. <p/> Hacking is done in agreement with the company, which also sets the rules for what the hacker can do and how far he can go, explains Boštjan Špehonja, who attended Unistar's RoglIT '15 conference as an independent expert. When conducting penetration tests, an ethical hacker avoids doing any harm, stealing data or deliberately disabling services, because we know that there are types of attacks that can temporarily disable a website. <p/> More vulnerabilities every day <p/> The fact that the number of intrusions is increasing does not mean that ethical hackers have more work to do. Špehonja explains that there is another constant here, as companies, both large and small, are not even aware yet of what data loss means in concrete terms. ""There is a big step to be taken here to make companies more aware. There are more vulnerabilities every day, and if an administrator falls asleep, there's no need for anyone to go after that company specifically. There are Chinese, there are Pakistanis, there are Nigerians who automatically scan the internet, public IPs, all day long. As soon as they realise that a particular system is vulnerable, an automation is running in the background to exploit that vulnerability and cause your system to be used for further attacks to mask the real attacker."" <p/> The problem lies in the belief of those in charge at many companies, who often wrongly assume that their data is of no interest to attackers. What is interesting are their computers, which hackers then exploit as bots for further attacks, explains Špehonja, who adds that while security starts with passwords, it is the human factor that he believes should be better educated in computer security. ""Safe use of the Internet seems to be a given. This is why children in school and kindergarten are not given enough emphasis on safe use of the internet, and the trends of online scams and scammers are on the rise,"" he explains, adding that, after all, you can get one email, click on a link, open a little program, and you are already infected and can lose all your data or, in the worst case, even suffer financial damage. <p/> Don't use keys found on the ground <p/> In the case of attacks on large companies, such as the ones we have seen recently, these are well-planned attacks that take months to plan, and the attackers usually send an insider. Often the hackers' work is made easier by the ""human factor"", whether it is misconfigured fire security or users clicking on them, and often hackers leave USB sticks in car parks for example, which are then found and used by employees, even though, as the ethical hacker explains, the ISO 27001 security policy states that sticks found on the ground are not to be inserted into company computers. ""These are all methods that are tested by attackers and sooner or later someone makes a mistake that opens the door to the company,"" concludes Špehonja. <p/> Anonymous well paid from behind the scenes <p/> When asked about the workings of Anonymous, the ethical hacker believes that it is a group that is well paid and run by someone, just like there are various viruses that are written specifically for the Middle East, which after seven years are found to have been funded by certain governments. ""My personal opinion is that the main men are funded by a certain side to carry out certain attacks. Of course, this is also a trend among young people, to be Anonymous and to put a mask on Facebook. It's a subculture that is being exploited. Anonymous has a whole bunch of programmes of its own, but there is also a double-edged sword here. You decide as a teenager to be a member of Anonymous, you use their program, which really gives you some advantages, because they teach you how to ""shekat"" a certain thing, which you would otherwise also get on the Internet, but by doing that you put your computer at risk, because you don't know if that little program was clean and if maybe your computer is already in the process of being prepared for some DDoS attack that they are doing in the background,"" explains Špehonja. <p/> Hackers in movies and in reality <p/> The movie Hacker is currently playing in cinemas.Visualising an intrusion is always a particularly challenging task, often with user interfaces that are either very graphically sophisticated or a simple DOS window with opaque program code or numbers flying by extremely fast. Spehonja explains how far this is from reality by saying that ""those numbers, those codes flying around, are usually laughed at by those of us who are in the field."" The IP 352.612.x.x is nonsense, because there is no such thing as a number greater than 255. ""As far as critical infrastructure is concerned, the degradation of water, transport infrastructure, electricity, etc. I would be careful what to say here, but it is also a possible attack. Of course it is possible, but of course it is more difficult. Such an attack would, of course, take a long time to prepare for, but the theoretical possibilities are there. After all, some people say that everything can be faked. Some people spend all day just writing programs that hack into other programs,"" adds the ethical hacker, who sees the movie scenes as being mostly exaggerated.",Information/Explanation

"Air passenger rights <p/> People are increasingly travelling by air, but we are not aware of our rights as air passengers and how to react if, for example, a flight is delayed or cancelled. The very first right we have is that the airline must keep us informed about flight cancellations and the duration of the delay, the further course of events and, last but not least, about our rights. <p/> All the information listed below applies to flights within the European Union, to non-EU flights destined for the EU and to flights with a European air carrier. <p/> Delays <p/> If you are delayed for two hours or more for flights up to 1,500 kilometres, three hours or more for flights between 1,500 and 3,500 kilometres and four hours or more for flights over 3,500 kilometres, you are entitled to a telephone call, refreshments, food, accommodation and transport to your accommodation. When the flight is delayed for more than five hours, you can choose not to continue your journey, in which case the airline must reimburse the cost of your ticket and provide you with air transport to the place where you started your journey within seven days. <p/> Denied boarding <p/> If overbooking occurs and passengers with valid tickets are denied boarding, airlines must first try to find volunteers to give up their booking in exchange for certain benefits. Volunteers or stranded passengers should be offered a choice between full reimbursement of the ticket cost or a refund of between €125 and €600, payable within seven days, and re-routing on comparable terms. If they choose the latter, the carrier must also provide them with food, access to a telephone, accommodation and transport from the airport to their accommodation. <p/> Flight cancellation <p/> If the airline gives you at least 14 days' notice of the cancellation, offers you a re-routing with a similar take-off and landing time, or can prove that the cancellation is due to exceptional circumstances, then you are not entitled to compensation. Otherwise, you are entitled to reimbursement of between €125 and €600, depending on the length of the flight, or to alternative transport to your desired destination as soon as possible. <p/> If you do not continue your journey because of the cancellation, the airline must reimburse you within seven days for the cost of the ticket for the unused flights and for the flight that was already operated but no longer served its intended purpose according to the original travel plan. You must also be provided with a telephone call if necessary, refreshments, food, accommodation and transport to your accommodation, and you are entitled to compensation. <p/> What should I do if my flight is delayed, cancelled or denied boarding? <p/> If you experience any of the inconveniences listed above, you should immediately request and exercise the relevant information about your rights from the staff at the check-in counter or boarding gate, which the carrier is obliged to provide to you in writing. If you are unsuccessful in exercising your rights, you should complain in writing to the air carrier as soon as possible and, if you are still unsuccessful, you can complain to the competent national authority. <p/> Lost or damaged baggage <p/> In the case of damaged baggage, you must file a claim with the airline within seven days of receiving your baggage, or up to 21 days if your baggage is delivered late.

"Bohinjska Bistrica - The weekend is upon us, and if the weather is nice, the car crowds will once again flock to the tourist spots. Also to Bohinj, where parking has always been a problem due to too many cars and not enough parking spaces. But as Miro Sodja, Director of the Bohinj Municipal Administration, says, there are solutions here too. This year, a larger, more affordable car park has been opened at the beginning of the village of Ribčev Laz, from where a regular free shuttle service to Lake Bohinj is also organised. Subsidised bus services have also been made more frequent in the lower and upper Bohinj valley, and the new bridge over the Sava Bohinjska has made the bicycle ride from Bohinjska Bistrica to the lake increasingly attractive. As the Director of Tourism Bohinj, Klemen Langus, said, they are taking small steps to help calm traffic during the peak summer tourist season. The possibility of renting electric bicycles could also be an interesting alternative to driving, Langus said.",News
"Repayment of the third quarter <p/> A press conference was held today, 25 February 2014, at the premises of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport (MESS) at 16 Masarykova cesta in Ljubljana, where State Secretary Aljuš Pertinač presented the method of securing funds for the payment of salary disproportions to public institutions that fall under the auspices of the Ministry of Education. <p/> According to the State Secretary, the Ministry of Education and Science received many negative reactions to the letter prepared by the Ministry of Finance concerning the provision of funds for the payment of the first instalment, namely that each direct and indirect budget user must provide the necessary funds for the payment of the salary differential due to the elimination of the third quarter of the basic salary disproportionality within its financial plans, since the additional funds needed for the payment of this obligation must not have an impact on the increase in the budget deficit. The MoFRE took the disagreements and professional concerns to the competent authorities in the Ministry of Finance and asked for help in resolving the issue, but ""all they heard was that fiscal consolidation was continuing and that there was no money"". <p/> The State Secretary said that, in view of the fact that the funds for the payment of the obligations under the Supreme Court judgment were not provided for in the 2014 Budget of the Republic of Slovenia, and in view of the aforementioned position of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia and the Ministry of Finance, the MoEFA, after careful consideration and in full awareness of the gravity of the situation, had decided to transfer the missing funds to the public institutions that would need the Ministry's assistance in securing the funds for the payment of payment of the first instalment of the salary disproportionality compensation. The Ministry's position is that the payment of the liabilities following the judgment should not adversely affect the performance of the core activities of public education and research. <p/> In January this year, the Ministry sent a letter to the indirect budget users under its responsibility stating that each indirect budget user in the field of activity of our Ministry should, as a rule, provide itself with the necessary funds for the payment of the first instalment of the salary difference, within the limits of the institution's available resources from previous years and the resources available for the implementation of the activities in 2014. Exceptionally, if a public institution demonstrates that it is unable to provide the funds to make the first instalment of the salary differential due to the abolition of the third quarter of the basic salary disparities, the Ministry should provide the additional funds. <p/> The Ministry assessed the institutions' applications for funds to pay the third quarter of the salary disproportionality according to uniform criteria, taking into account the estimated surplus of revenue over expenditure or expenditure over revenue as at 31.12.2013, taking into account the expenditure on the third quarter of the salary disproportionality for the period from 1.10.2010 to 31.7.2011. The Ministry co-finances applications from institutions up to an amount that covers the estimated deficit of expenditure over revenue as at 31.12.2013. In addition, according to Aljuš Pertinač, the Ministry also took into account the liquidity criterion and examined the balance of cash, bank credits and short-term financial investments as at 31.12.2013 in relation to the amount of the first instalment liability. <p/> For a full explanation of the criteria according to which the MoEFCC assessed the institutions' applications, please watch the video of the press conference below. <p/> Your comment:",News

"Hoyla, What I was naively convinced would not happen, at least not on a large scale, has started to happen on OLC. Since the OLC is also - or mainly - a competition that is judged, and for which awards are even given at the end of the season in some categories, one would expect the participants to respect the basic principles of fair play. The IGC track is a blatant fraud; it cannot be understood or managed in any other way. In the next few days a valid G-record will become mandatory in all competition categories. This solution is not ideal, because some instruments do not make a G-record, and someone will probably be deprived because of this, but I do not see any other possibility. At the same time, suspicious flights will start to be manually checked as of today, and tampered tracks will get a very visible ""GOLUFIA"" marking. lp, aljosa <p/> All flights where the rules have been broken could be automatically deleted.

"Heh, but this kind of statement baffles me... are these compartmentalising people consistent? So dogs are supposed to be lonely according to them. What about for the fish? What about cats? Or chinchillas? What about birds, turtles, horses, etc.? Gosh, I find this really funny. I'll tell you. For all the animals, there are people who know how to see the joy in any daddy. <p/> A puppy is <p/>really such a sweet companion who gets you out and about - whether you're lonely or there are too many Kittens around, you just like to go to peace for a bit. And another thing - there really is something in his eyes that you rarely find in human eyes - loyalty without selfishness, M. <p/> Well, to be fair <p/> (and not in the style of I. Gartner! ), then it has to be said that a lot of people have a dog because they ARE lonely. AND very lonely! There are too many people who are canine asocials and would rather have a dog than a human companion. There are far too many (let's say) grandmothers who don't watch their grandchildren because the children make their pet...um...nervous.....There are far too many people who prefer dogs to children.... There have been heated debates about this on some forums this year.... <p/> In short... THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE who have lost touch with reality and give a dog the love they are incapable of giving to their fellow man. <p/> But that doesn't mean that we are not normal in between.... <p/> Those of us who love dogs, but at the same time know that a dog - however we turn it - is still "" just "" an animal. .... . <p/> MM <p/> Untitled comment <p/> I knew someone who was always greeted happily by a puppy when he came home from work. he said, a little jokingly, that the puppy always made him happy, but his wife never once greeted him so happily at the door, greeting him, d <p/> auntie:) <p/> I disagree. if there's anything a single man is already missing - it's a partner. i.e. a man. but somehow I persist in believing that he's not looking for a dog, heh. because a dog can't replace a man. it can only bring him more life and depth. and that's got nothing to do with this situation. <p/> you want a dog if you like it as a creature. that's how it is when you are a child and when you grow up. the feeling of loneliness is born in the person, not in the surroundings. even married people have it sometimes. <p/> but if some unfortunate soul takes it (the dog) for that reason... the uiber has brought himself around, heh. because in that case the dog is just a means to keep himself so busy that he 'forgets' his feelings. a workaholic would then work more. gulp. self-curation and problem-solving I call it. <p/> for me, the dog has never been a means of making contact. i do just fine without it. <p/> giggles, clots:) <p/> I don't really bother about what is found in a dog and what is found in a person. both are fine with me. the dog comes to me, I like it and therefore I accept the whole package it brings. <p/> for me <p/> animals are part of life, they belong to human life, just like other people do. But it is true that it can be much more tiring to coexist with people than with animals. A human being is a bit half degenerated in our time here and now...., (puneguzitsevsegapachserjessepovsodane... ) and his psyche is fucking him up, of course, the cockroach yes... so it's really healing to socialize with animals <p/> hm, milena:) <p/> to be fair, I assume that many people have said so themselves. what I think about this, I already said in my reply to my aunt... come on, please read it, so I don't write it again. <p/> but if you feel that way about it, from your reasoning... i guess i don't need to point out that it is a labelling and / or she-said-she-said system. so far from real and fair for me. <p/> i have said many times before that i find it disingenuous to devote exclusively to animals or exclusively to humans (and not really in this post yet). and i find the not saving grandmothers with grandchildren you mention from this very title sick (and vice versa as well). it's just that you have to take the time to educate the children about the dog (some are really total antitalents) and the dog about the children. i think it's a good idea to take the time to educate the children about the dog (one is really a total antitalent) and the dog about the children. i think it's a good idea to educate the children about the dog. <p/>people who prefer dogs to children and people who prefer dogs to people are in the same basket. the difference is only in age, but it's the same. <p/> otherwise, this post is about the fact that being a dog guardian is not even close to being lonely after defolt. <p/> I love dogs. I love people. and any way you turn it - man is also ' just ' an animal. if mankind, in its self-importance, discarded all other living beings, it would breathe nothing and could only eat itself. the funny thing is that sometimes it does it without doing that. <p/> giggles, darja:) <p/> but I don't take them literally as a rule (somehow it makes sense to me that there was probably a period of falling in love, hihi). it is true, though, that we humans have this poison in us called self-importance. and then the dog's ability to be happy every time is quite charming. <p/> and you know, I didn't usually meet any guy at the door either, hehehehe... because I don't hear or smell as well as a dog. <p/> duck:) <p/> but the point this time is quite different. the point is that we should respect humans too. um. well, it's really intertwined, yes. if you respect both the animal and the human, then a respectful attitude towards the coexistence of animals and humans is quite automatic. <p/> just this one <p/> we have it too and I can't imagine not having it because it has brought such joy to everybody that it's hard to say. <p/> What I find interesting is a statement my child once made when we asked him how it is that he treats kittens and puppies differently from people, shows them all the love, in short, treats them differently from the way he used to treat people.His answer was ANIMALS HAVE NEVER NEEDED MAN BUT MORE THAN ONCE AGAIN. <p/> Hey Mermaid <p/> Yes, animals are part of life and being with man. Whether they live with you or with a neighbour. In my life I have had the opportunity to observe completely different cultures in relation to fish. Let's say in Greece. The dog strictly belongs out of the house. It is not allowed to sit on the sofa or armchair. Or bring hair and germs from outside to inside. They don't even let it near a small child. And if by chance a little furry thing wandered into the playground, the mums would scream and shout. And if the unfortunate creature had the misfortune to make a lot of noise (especially in the cities), it wasn't too hard for the neighbours to poison the dog (we had a kitten in Athens once, and I don't even know what it did to them). <p/> On the other hand, I observe the English. They are very nice to animals (well, there are extreme exceptions, but I'm speaking generally). In the army and police, dogs get decorations and titles (Sargeant, Lutenant, etc.), and there is not a house in the countryside that doesn't have two dogs. When I asked ""my"" family why they all have two dogs, they said: ""So that the fish don't get lonely... all the time, we are not and can't be with them all the time, so it's nice not to have just one animal but to have a family! ""So it's not that humans need company, but that the dog also needs company. I also meet people from other cultures who find fish ""unclean"". Yes, there are different views. Only those who really know how important fish are respect them. And now, in England, they are considering reintroducing the brown bear and the wolf, which are also native here, but have historically been exterminated. I am very interested to see how this debate ends. <p/> Grandma:) <p/> hmm... i wouldn't talk about how many of them and why they prefer a dog to a child... because i don't know any of them and i don't have one. when i try to empathise... the thing that jumps out at me the most is that it's easier to protect a dog. if you don't trust the world, the upbringing and the influences of others... it's easier to be responsible for a puppy. because you can separate it from the upbringing of a stranger. but anyway, i insist that it's not ok to turn away from people. <p/> I don't like this kind of labelling in general. i know couples who had a dog for a long time but not a child. now they have a child too. and i find it ugly and unnecessary to just compartmentalise. there is no rule what you have to have first. <p/> and I honestly don't see why anyone should be obliged to coach football instead of volleyball, or have 2 children instead of one, or go into parenthood if they don't want to (or as long as they don't want to). to please others? Why? let them live their own ideas and performances... <p/> and why should someone who doesn't want to have children - and a dog - be worse than someone who doesn't want either a child or a dog? but someone who doesn't want to have children and has fish is immaculate in everyone's eyes, or what? <p/> if someone wants to have children, let them have them, yes, in these cases it is the motives that matter. if they don't want to have children, they don't. let others have that freedom of choice, and let us stick to our own. it is a great disservice to the child to impose social pressure on the child. <p/> zuzi:) <p/> hi, it's true that they are part of life. but when it comes to living and being a neighbour, it's both direct and indirect. it's all part of life, but there are significant differences. <p/> let's say. i have a ricky. i chose to live with him, not with all the dogs of all the neighbours. the neighbours don't bother me (even when they are loud, no), but they are not so directly part of my life that i would want to pee their poo out of my garden. luckily the neighbours are so correct that it's clear to them, heh. <p/> and there are differences in societies, yes... for me, the english version is the closest. i find it very real this respect for all beings, to see not only through oneself, but also to them, for them.",Forum
"Coronary heart disease <p/> Share: <p/> Coronary heart disease is a condition that develops when the coronary arteries, the main blood vessels that supply the heart with food and oxygen, become damaged or diseased. Coronary artery disease is most often caused by plaque deposits (plaques), which contain cholesterol. <p/> Plaque on the walls of the arteries narrows the artery and reduces blood flow, which means that the heart receives insufficient oxygen and nutrients. Reduced blood flow can cause chest pain and shortness of breath. When a blood vessel is completely blocked, a heart attack can occur. But this never happens from today to tomorrow. In fact, coronary heart disease is a disease that takes years and decades to develop before it shows its teeth. For a long time, the patient has no symptoms and is not even aware of it, which is why it is so dangerous. Because it develops slowly, the patient is also unaware of the changes in his or her lungs, which he or she most often attributes to ageing. Then, suddenly, he is struck by a heart attack (another name for myocardial infarction). That is why it is important to protect ourselves against coronary heart disease while we have time, while our actions will be most effective. The recipe for this is well known: healthy living or lifestyle changes: a healthier diet with less fat, good quality fats, more fresh vegetables and fruit, lots of smaller meals, chewing food for a long time, more fish and less red meat, but also less alcoholic beverages, no smoking and as much exercise as possible. It's a recipe we all know, but it can be hard to follow. <p/> If the coronary arteries are narrowed, they cannot supply the heart with the blood that gives it oxygen. When the heart is beating strongly, for example during physical activity or if we are under severe stress, this lack of oxygenated blood is particularly dangerous. In the beginning, poor blood flow will not cause any major problems. However, as the plaque builds up and the coronary arteries have less and less flow, the patient will have various health problems. One of the best known is chest pain, a tightness or squeezing, as if someone were squeezing your chest. This pain is usually caused by the physical or mental stress mentioned above. Women typically feel the pain slightly differently from men: as a stabbing and very sharp pain in the abdomen, back or arm. A fairly typical warning sign is shortness of breath. If we walk up some stairs that not long ago we could jump up and down without any problems, but now we are short of breath, we should be alert and tell our doctor. Extreme tiredness, exhaustion, can also be a sign of illness. <p/> When the pain is very severe, do not wait. You should see a doctor immediately. It will be best if such a patient is taken straight to the emergency room. Time is very precious in such cases and timely and correct action can save a life.",Information/Explanation

Lean into the carbon plate under your feet, but make sure you don't pinch the windscreen washer button, which is down there. We'll be bounced around a bit, but you can hold on to the roll cage with your hands,"" Nicolas explained to me as we prepared to start our adventure in the cockpit of the works car. <p/> No, it wasn't a flight in a military jet fighter, but the experience was very similar. Two adrenaline-fuelled men (well, at least one of them certainly was), both wearing flame-retardant pyjamas, helmets on their heads, strapped firmly into a clam seat, chatting in the cockpit of a hellishly expensive machine, surrounded by wires, switches, levers, monitors and carbon-fibre components. The hot, bare metal interior is permeated by the intoxicating, almost slightly intoxicating, smell of high-octane propellant. Mhm ... it really does smell like mint tea. How soothing and calming. It should also be prescribed drop by drop in pharmacies to all petrol addicted racing drivers and journalists. <p/> When the cabin door closes, a mad but sadly all too brief adventure begins, which is actually akin to driving a jet fighter. With one difference. That, of course, those of us who have had the opportunity to ride in a jet military aircraft are, after all, outnumbered by those of us who have sat behind the wheel or in the passenger seat of such a vehicle. In Russia, for many years now, it has been possible to take a ride in a MiG, and at the airport in Slovenj Grad it is also possible to buy a ticket for a ride in a south-eastern seagull. <p/> You cannot buy a ride in a Peugeot 307 WRC. For no money. Especially not a drive in a factory car, behind the wheel of which, just a few days ago, former World Rally Champion Marcus Gronholm was still sitting. Well, it's true that it is possible to buy a 307 WRC, or it will be possible next season. But it's also true that you will only be able to get your hands on this car with good connections and if you have at least a few virtuoso drives or if you can boast World Rally Championship-level results beforehand. <p/> Well, then, you are only a modest few hundred thousand euros away from buying such a hand-built racing car. The official figure, according to the men from Peugeot's motorsport department, is between 700 thousand and a million euros. But as one local racing driver said, once you've bought the car, all you need is a bucket and a cloth. At least to clean it every now and then, because you're not going to drive it anyway. Unless you've also bought, for almost the same amount, the spare parts and the big truckload of equipment needed to maintain such a race car. And you need a team of four or five mechanics (read engineers) who are skilled in maintaining, servicing and handling this sophisticated apparatus on four wheels. <p/> Jeep, the Peugeot 307 WRC is no longer just a racing car. It's a top-quality machine for achieving the highest goals. It is a machine for winning rallies in the World Rally Championship. <Let's get back in the car! Having driven a few laps of Peugeot's previous 206 world rally car on this same circuit two years ago, I kind of knew what to expect. Well, at least I had a hunch, unlike Avtomagazin's Dusan and Alyosha, who were about to be baptised by fire. Several years of active participation in the domestic rally championship, and two years as a co-driver before that, had given me the courage to sit in the passenger seat for the three demonstration laps, completely relaxed and smiling ear to ear. To see what a little Frenchman can do behind the wheel of a big Frenchman. Come on, poba, scare me if you can, I thought, because the man doesn't know anyway that I'm no stranger to racing and that I've driven a similar car on this very track. <p/> But my smile and my courage did not last long. Even though I knew that the car allowed everything that was already beyond the limits of what was possible and had nothing to do with the law of gravity and the rest of physics, after the first metres and the turns, I was breathless. No, I wasn't afraid that something would go wrong, because I trusted the driver, the car and the safety of the track. I was more amazed at what the car really could do and how docilely controllable it was in the hands of a true master. You know, when you're behind the wheel yourself, the first thing you want to do is to get the whole car back, because the Peugeot people wouldn't be too impressed if I tipped their toy on the roof. The question is whether, after such a misfortune, they would have let me get behind the wheel of, say, a 308 WRC in 2008. <p/> After half a lap I started to enjoy it again. With one eye on the track in front of us, I was watching to see if the owners had changed any of the corners in two years, and with the other eye I was watching Vouilloso twisting the steering wheel, when to change gear, when to apply the handbrake, how he was pressing on the accelerator, whether he was braking with his left foot or his right foot, and so on. Our two laps were over too quickly, but I was quite happy. It was a pure pleasure to drive, but the fact that we finished meant something completely different. That we were going to change seats. For the next three laps, the little Frenchman goes into the passenger seat, and I cram myself into a seat that is too narrow, the steering wheel too long. To give him back his dear soap. <p/> The journalist colleagues in front of me have already worn out the Michelin racing tyres for the gravel, so Nicolas motions for me to pit. <p/> ""Let's get a fresh set of tyres and refuel,"" he says, and it occurs to me that sometimes it's not a bad idea to be last in line. New tyres! Yes, when I'm racing alone, I hear that word too rarely, unfortunately. Meanwhile, I pull the Peugeot into the red service area and the engineers roll out a set of new tyres from the big service truck, which is resplendent with stars and wreaths indicating the number of World Championship wins. Mhm, just for me. And I'm enjoying every moment. <p/> The vehicle is lifted onto four special pedestals by two cranes and all four wheels are taken off at the same time. The four of them struggle to replace them and all I hear behind the wheel is the shrill beeping of the electric wheel-bolting guns. The head of engineering lifts the bonnet and plugs in a laptop computer, checking that the engine is OK. <p/> And I am still sitting behind the wheel, waiting for the team to do their job. The guys wipe down the windows, scrape the mud, soil and stones that have accumulated around the wheels off the undercarriage and, in the meantime, someone opens the tailgate and uses a pump to pump high-octane, highly flammable, fast-burning, volatile racing petrol into the car's fuel tank. <p/> Mama mia, if only moments like that lasted forever! Can you imagine how soothing such a situation is for the ego of a casual and hobby racer from the sunny side of the Alps? ! Like valerian drops. Sitting in the factory car of a former world champion, with the team around you trying to prepare the car for your drive, while you chat about the car's special features with your co-driver, the guy who stunned the world this year with a great drive and top times in the Rally de Catalunya. Yah, and what good does that do him? He can still just be my co-driver! <p/> Joke aside: Nicolas Vouilloz is a nice man. The multiple world downhill mountain bike champion has a two-year contract with Peugeot. He competes in eight World Championship rallies in last year's 206 WRC under the Peugeot factory team. The world got to know him at this year's Rally de Catalunya, where he finished 10th overall and twice finished second on stages, once just three tenths of a second behind the winner. Talent! The driver of the future? Undoubtedly, as he was also behind multiple World Champion and reigning champion Peter Solberg and this year's champion Sebastjan Loeb. <p/> Nicolas tells me to pull the metal lever on the steering wheel quickly and hard towards me. The car twitches slightly and a big orange R appears on the screen in front of the driver. I move the same lever away from the steering wheel. I pull the lever. Position 1. First gear. Let's go. Slowly to the racetrack. I look at my co-driver, who knows exactly what I'm interested in. <p/> He just nods his head. You can do it! Greeemooooooooo! Gaaaas! Jihaaaaaaa! The cake goes off like a cannon. With two carbon rings on the steering wheel, you shift up and down with just the finger of one hand. It's just like Formula 1, but instead of buttons on the steering wheel, there's a ring. Why? Because you have to turn the steering wheel rapidly as the car slides sideways through corners, and the gearshift button is always close at hand. That way, the steering wheel is always in place in any position. Where you need it. <p/> After the first lap, my co-driver opened the door to a world of heaven by moving the knob on the centre console two laps. He switched the engine electronics programme from the stage position to the post-stage position. The car breathed at the top of its lungs. The loud popping of the electronics of the turbine-powered vehicles was virtually inaudible in the car. Only the electronic hiss and shifting of the turbo gearbox, combined with the waterfalls of rocks loudly blasting the bottom of the car as the wheels spin idle under the sheer force of the power, caress the ears. <p/> The Peugeot soars over rough potholes. And every new gear is rewarded with a jolt to the shin and a new sticking of both occupants deep into the racing seat. By far the most impressive thing about the car is the insanely good chassis. It absorbs potholes you think will rip the wheels off and makes sure that even on long jumps, the car lands unfeelingly on the wheels. Crazy! The brakes are the same, stopping the car at 100 or 130 km/h before a corner as if it were cemented in place, after just a gentle touch of the racing shoe. And that's on gravel. <p/> I can say that I have never driven a more drivable, more beautiful, more docile and predictable car. The 307 WRC is a true special, a car that drives itself. Well, just the wrong way. In fact, it's the only car that really is driven by the driver, not the other way around. Once you get a taste of this machine, you realise that in a ""civilian"" car, the car is still being driven by the driver, who is trying very hard to keep it on the road. <p/> It is a testament to how tame this beast can be that, believe it or not, during our drive, my co-driver, the very saintly Nicolas Vouilloz, also grabbed the safety cage firmly with his right hand on several occasions, and unexpectedly hissed ""ssssssssss"" through his teeth into my intercom, which could only mean that the boy does not like to ride in the passenger seat very much, or that I was unexpectedly fast in certain corners, even for such a master of the steering wheel. Yes, you'll never imagine what a great compliment it is for a racing driver when such a master inadvertently utters, ""Ssssss! "" <p/> And so we're driving home in a 90-horsepower diesel, lazily making our way along the straight highways of France, Germany and Austria to Ljubljana, when my TV colleague Stropnik throws me a bone: ""Dude, what fools we are! We are driving 1300 kilometres there and 1300 kilometres back. We spend two days in the car and a lot of money on fuel and tolls. All to drive three laps there - in the car! Who can understand that? At least if you were there after driving for twelve hours, you could run around for three laps or ride a bicycle, instead of just getting in another car, doing three laps and then skating home for another twelve hours..."" <p/> Hm, actually David is quite right. We are indeed weirdos, but at the same time I know very well that he thinks exactly the same as me. For three more laps in that car, we'd turn back again in a heartbeat... <p/> ID card <p/> Title: Peugeot 307 WRC (world rally car) <p/> Year built: 2004 <p/> Owner: Peugeot Motorsport France <p/> Number of examples in existence: 2 registered, about 6 built <p/> Driver: Marcus Gronholm <p/> Price: not for sale <p/> Value: €800,000 to €1,000,000 <p/> Mission: to win individual events and the world rally championship",Review

"Rafael Nadal of Spain, the world's No.2 player and arguably the best sand court player in history, defeated David Ferrer of Spain 7:6 (1), 7:5 in straight sets in the final of the ATP 500 tournament in Barcelona after a close encounter. Ferrer was thus left empty-handed for the fourth time in Barcelona. For Nadal, this is his 7th title in a row, as he has lifted the trophy every time since 2005, but did not appear in 2010! <p/> The two Spaniards have competed 18 times in their careers, 6 of them in finals. The win/loss ratio is 14:4 for Rafael, who has never lost a final against David! <p/> Unlike last year, Ferrer offered a decent resistance this time, but Nadal showed in key moments why he is hard to beat on the sandy surface. In the 1st set, both managed one break point each, Nadal saved 5 break point opportunities from Ferrer in 12 games, and in the end, he sovereignly won the extra game, where Ferrer won the only point. The first set lasted 93 minutes! <p/> In the 2nd set, both players lost serve 2 times each, until the last 12 games when Rafael ended the match with 3 more breaks. The second set could have ended in the hands of Ferrer, who served for a 5:4 lead, but he finished the smash badly at the net, putting Nadal back in the game and himself psychologically down! <p/> The match, which was played in just 2 sets, lasted 2 hours and 41 minutes! <p/> "" For me, this was the toughest match on sand this season.

"Velenje has been noted for many years as an exceptionally well-kept and hospitable city. It was built on black coal, deliberately and thoughtfully, according to the ideas of eminent European and landscape architects. Its modern urban architecture makes it completely different from other cities and many tourists are pleasantly surprised by the city. Many people have a very different image of the city, with its coal mines and developed industry, than it really is. This year, Velenje celebrated important anniversaries: 55 years since the official opening of the newly built city centre and 750 years since the first written mention of the market square, with the renovation of the city centre, providing a modern and attractive space for walking and socialising. <p/> Last year, Velenje came second in the ""bigger cities"" category of the My Land - Beautiful and Welcoming project. Velenje has been awarded the first prize for tidiness six times (1995, 1999, 2001, 2007, 2009, 2010), second place in 2011, third place in 2012 and first place in the online voting. <p/> Kind regards, Public Relations Service of the Municipality of Velenje",Promotion
"After two Mondays in a row what I promised myself not to get out of my head happened, I had to load too much and too little into my phone, into the target and past it, especially for you, instead of having a good read of the 5200 characters of a meaningful and concise summary, this time, just in case, I am starting to write on Sunday, 30. January at 7:15 pm at the ICSMC Office while an all-day meeting of anarchists is going on in the hall, who have asked me not to publish their photos because violent Nazis are searching for their faces on the web. <p/> The Carnian Outlaws are still retreating from the Cultural Pool after ten years of occupying this monument to the ruined social system of socialism. Behind the latter, Šulc sheds no tears. In a decisive internal document, the municipality of Kranj, and the people with names and surnames in it, judged the Pool to be a building fit for demolition, and this made the job of Gross, the representative of the land-owners, much easier. For the last two years, the Municipality has been RENTING a building built by self-managed labour from a ""generous"" representative of the entitled descendants for a large sum of money. This temporary unhealthy state of affairs has ended, the four-day over-the-top festival ""Dost mamo"" with the subtitle ""Izbruh's Last Pogo in the Swimming Pool"" has been survived by Šulc et al, and the property of the Izbruh Association is being moved to a warehouse, which, with luck, has been borrowed by a comrade. Gregor Kosi of the Bakery and I agree to convene the first meeting of the Pohorje Battalion in Kranj near Brdo and there let ourselves be irradiated by the facts and impressions of the freshly abandoned self-contained scene. In ten years of cultural struggles, at many hundreds of events, no one was killed and no one was wounded. Gregor and I are determined to drive the wedge that the Bakery Industry drove into the bottom of the Pool at the ""Slovenian Cultural Pig"" a few years ago. <p/> Franjo Frančič visited the MKSMC on Monday, bringing three books for our library that are being discarded by public libraries for lack of interest: the first is Dr. Franjo Derganec's memoir ""The Bloody Rose"", the second is Lad Ambrožić Novljan's ""March of the Fourteenth"", and the third is ""Radio Liberation Front"" by Jože Javoršek. Franjo was happy to see a good direction by Katja Peganova for his text. He was returning from Trieste where the premiere took place. He was constantly talking and hitting the nail on the head, describing today's youth as the wormy foundation of the future. He is happy that his daughter listens to Edot Maajko and he went to buy her ""Spomen ploćo"" for her birthday. <p/> On Monday, when I was ""like a sick shit"" (claims my wife Arijana) getting ready to report for four years of soft terrorism and to complete my report to the Youth Office, the top brass of the Likej Association came by, with Tonči Kuzmanić, let's say, at the head. I was unpleasantly surprised because Tonči does not see the unravelling or complication of the current issue of the municipality of Ankara as clear proof that the right and the left are united, because it is about the interests of Capital or the Port of Koper. It seems quite obvious to me that the parliamentary parties are in no hurry to comply with the will of a few thousand citizens, never mind the millions of euros that the Port of Koper brings in. Tonči has been incomprehensibly reticent in his assessment of the matter. His first reaction was that he did not know enough about the matter. <p/> On Tuesday, I met with a lover of tidiness and efficient use of time and space, Simon Kardum, at the Kino Šiška. He was accompanied by his henchman Manček, who some time ago lectured me to be ashamed of myself for putting myself at the head of the Youth Field NGO Foundation at the age of sixty. There will be nothing of Brecljevanie in Šiška, but on 9 March this year, in the cathedral, which is by no means a public cultural trough, there will be a multimedia event ""Feu Marko Brecelj"" with a performance by a second-hand singer-songwriter, video projections and performances by DPZN. The subtitle of the event is ""For the second time, for the first time at Kino Šiška"". The first time I performed there with the Bulldozers was in 1975 at the Golden M. We did a performance called ""Day of Disease"" and we called it ""Ashes and Leukaemia"". <p/> On Wednesday, during the day, we sent out the Doganetta ""Judgement in the name of the people"", and in the evening, Franci Blašković presented an excellent CD ""Kobra je u brajdi"" at the Kabina Gallery, and one with which he is not satisfied: ""Ipak je lepiej travu pušiti nego Gori uši slušati"". On the night of Wednesday to Thursday I had no choice: I plunged myself into slow and mind-numbingly weak reporting for the aforementioned reputable institutions. I smoked French cigarettes exceptionally during this effort. The substantive report for the four-year soft terrorism programme may be of interest to some. It will be published at www.dodogovor.org. <p/> On Thursday morning the MKSMC came to do electrical measurements and came across a sleepless man from Klanec. I immediately called their boss and ""dropped"" Supervisor Vid and Supervisor Samuel on him at ten o'clock. These two young members of ours described and listed in detail the oversights and negligence of his unforgettable contractors, headed by the palm buyer Danjel. That afternoon Dr Vlasta Jalušić gave a lecture on ""History, Politics, Law / Rights: Hegel"" in the MKSMC hall but unfortunately I was unable to attend due to the unavoidable financial part of the report to the Youth Office. It was super fine, I was half out of my mind. And at the end, cinema! Vid spun us the US-Argentine 35 millimeter too crime flick ""Our Father"" (""Padre nuestro""). <p/> On Friday, when I was quite euphoric from nine hours of sleep, Arijana started to sweat and immediately gave me a dramatic ultimatum. The nine formerly thick white envelopes with slips of paper, receipts, lists and now and then even notes, which had been (briefly) waiting in the top left inside pocket of my jacket for eight months to three weeks to be counted and sorted out by me, had to go immediately on the table and into the sunlight and under the magnifying glass. Some of the receipts for the June Friendship Offensive were barely legible with a magnifying glass and a good deal of imagination, and one no longer had a speck of colour on it. At the time of writing, the contents of all the envelopes have been examined three times, the worn envelopes have been replaced with new ones, and things have been tidied up and sorted out in my pocket and in my head. The anarchists left two hours ago, the kitchen is left in order, Teja and Luka have cleaned the floor! Cha, cha, cha, cha. <p/> Vid has just embedded an audio recording of Friday's meeting with the initiative groups organising the concerts on the Dodogovor website archive (Sunday, 30 January 2011 at 23:20). It's not short and it's mostly me speaking. I had so much to say about our twenty years of fighting against the wind and the reasons for the decision to freeze the DPZN co-organisation in February and March. You are welcome to listen! It is better for you if you give it up. Only then don't bring out the insulting, yellow details of my truthful and righteous sub-pedagogical fabrications. We're already at six thousand seven hundred characters, the situation is alarming, my sturdy editor Boris Vasev is looking at his watch, and there's just this: on Saturday twenty of us watched a good Jarmusch's ""Coffee and Cigarettes"", Vid was baking popcorn, and Tomi suggested a hip hop concert by the uncontrolled in the last days of February. Who are the Uncontrolled? They are Slovenian citizens without controlled origins: mainly Bosnians, blacks, American women under Triglav. I have long been urging them to come to MKSMC to prepare something, which of course Breclj with his negative karma could not manage! But 23 year old semi-controlled Tommy, the president of the ""KAM"" association, managed to do it. When we are allowed to vote in Koper, he will stand as an independent candidate. Vote for him!

"Lithuania wins, National TV disgraces <p/> The European Junior Basketball Championships concluded yesterday after ten days of competition, with Lithuania winning. After an unfortunate loss to France in the quarter-finals, then to Germany for 5th place, our national team managed to beat Greece yesterday by a huge margin for 7th place. So, out of nine matches, our team won seven and lost two. I am quite satisfied with what the younger members have shown, because they still have a lot of basketball challenges ahead of them, but I am much less satisfied with the coverage of the matches on our national television. <p/> I have to admit that this was the first time I watched the European Junior Basketball Championships, as in previous years I didn't even follow basketball that much, but that changed with the 2010 World Championships. So now I watch our national team whenever I can and I can say that I have never been as disappointed with TV Slovenia's coverage as I was with this year's European Championships. The whole event took place in Slovenia, with matches in Kranjska Gora, Domžale and Ljubljana. The first match was played by the younger members of our national team on Thursday 12 July, when the championship kicked off, against Italy. I did not even know that the matches started on that day, even though I follow TV SLO 1 and 2 quite a lot, because I did not see a single announcement for the championship, as I did, for example, a month ago for the football championship or now for the Olympic Games. It seems that they are much more interested in commercials than in viewers, and the junior championships are obviously less important than the senior championships. But after the Italy game, the news reported: <p/> RTV SLO will broadcast the matches on TV SLO Channel 2 and on the web portal from Monday, when the second round of the competition starts. <p/> Quite interesting, as the competition took place in Slovenia and next year we will be hosting the 2013 European Basketball Championship for Members, also hosted by Slovenia. This deprived me of watching the three games on television, but with the upcoming championships, we could prepare for the best possible coverage in the future. As I mentioned, there was no trailer, and thus no major publicity for the championships, so I missed the first day of the second part of the competition. Fortunately, at least they were posting news about it on their portal, so I caught the end of the second match of the second part. From then on I thought everything would be fine, but it wasn't. I watched the very next match on TV SLO 2 HD and the coverage was so disastrous that I can only wonder what will happen next at the 2013 EP and what will the performance be like then. During the broadcast, the picture was interrupted several times so that only the commentator could be heard, and the footage of the last actions at the beginning and end was played with such a blackout that the whole thing was unwatchable. <p/> After the unfortunate defeat against France, when our national team was still in contention for 5th place, I was already looking for the next broadcast, but I could not find it on the schedule or on any of the channels the next day. There are actually four channels - TV SLO 1, 2 and 3 and the online channel, MMC TV - but none of them had the coverage that many of us who followed the championships missed. The most surprising thing is that after the end of both the 5th place match and the France race (which took place at a time when there could have been coverage on TV SLO 2), there was a clip of the European Football Championship, instead of which there could have been a clip of this match. Fortunately, for the last match for 7th place, they only arranged for a broadcast, which still (for me at least) did not justify the mistakes that they should not have made. <p/>I only hope that for the 2013 European Basketball Championship, coverage will be provided, not only for our team's matches, but also for other matches, because it is nice to see other teams playing as well.",Opinion/Argumentation

"Origins <p/> Despite claims by the government of the People's Republic of China that Taiwan has always been part of China, its historical records do not record this. The earliest official records of Taiwan date back to the Three Kingdoms Period (222-280), when the first exploratory expedition of several thousand people was sent to the island from the Kingdom of Wu. However, in these records, Taiwan is identified as an area outside the boundaries of Chinese civilisation. When the island began to be colonised by foreign powers in the 16th century, the majority of the island's inhabitants were of Malayo-Polynesian origin, not of Han ethnicity. <p/>European trading bases (1624-1662) <p/>The first European conquerors to take an interest in Taiwan were the Portuguese, but they did not colonise the island. They called it Ihla Formosa, or Beautiful Island, and took the name with them to the world in the mid-16th century. The Dutch, who arrived from Indonesia and the Philippines in 1622, initially settled the Penghu Islands (Pescadores), where they established military rule. From there, they controlled maritime traffic in the Taiwan Strait and made passage difficult for Portuguese traders. In 1624, they were driven out by Ming troops and relocated to the main island of Taiwan. From Tainan, they dominated the south-western part of the island. The northern part of Taiwan was occupied by the Spanish conquistadors in 1626, but the Dutch drove them out in 1642. The Dutch government encouraged Chinese immigration to Taiwan because it needed a large labour force on the rice and sugar cane plantations. <p/>The Zheng family government (1662-1683) <p/> In China, Ming subjects fought against the Manchus, who gradually occupied China. In 1644, the Manchu Qing dynasty ruled China and the loyal Ming military forces fled to Taiwan. Commander Zheng Cheng-gong 鄭成功 (Koxinga), who had settled in northern Taiwan, continued to fight the Manchus for almost two decades, with the aim of re-establishing the Ming dynasty in China. After several unsuccessful battles in China, in 1661 he rebelled against the Dutch government in Taiwan and negotiated an agreement to take power. 1662 saw the establishment of the Kingdom of Dongning 東寧, which, after Koxinga's death, was ruled by a son and a grandson until 1683, when the Qing dynasty took power. At that time, Taiwan became administratively part of Fujian Province (臺灣府) and thus part of the multi-ethnic Manchu Empire of the Qing Dynasty. <p/> Qing Dynasty (1683-1895) <p/> During this period, thousands of poor Chinese immigrants came to Taiwan in search of a new start and a better life. Most of them were employed on cane and rice plantations, which were the main export commodities. As a result of the Opium Wars (between 1839-42 and 1856-60), 4 Taiwanese ports were opened to foreign traders, making Taiwan increasingly attractive in international trade. Taiwanese sugar, camphor, indigo and tea were highly sought-after export commodities. During the Sino-French War of Vietnam (1884-5), the northern part of Taiwan was occupied by the French and it was only then that the Chinese court slowly became aware of the vulnerability of the Chinese coastline to attack by foreign forces and the strategic role Taiwan played in this. The signing of the armistice between France and the Qing dynasty was followed by a reorganisation of the political administration, making Taiwan an independent province of the Qing Empire in 1885. The provincial capital is moved from Tainan to Taipei, and gradually Taiwan becomes much stronger. <p/>Japanese rule (1895-1945) in Taiwan and developments on the mainland<p/> In 1894, the Japanese invasion of Korea, which the Qing dynasty regarded as its tributary state, sparked the first Sino-Japanese War. Under the harsh terms of the Shimonoseki Peace Treaty of 1895, which formally ended the war, Taiwan, together with the Penghu Islands, was handed over to Japan. The people of Taiwan were disappointed by the dynasty's decision and tried to fight the Japanese invaders on their own. They established the Republic of Taiwan 臺灣民主國, which survived 5 months of fierce battles, from May to October 1895. <p/> During the 1950s, Japan carried out a systematic assimilation of the Taiwanese and rapidly developed the island's economy. Taiwan had by then developed the most modern industrial and transport infrastructure in Asia (except for Japan itself), which set the stage for Taiwan's further development. <p/> In China, however, disillusionment with Manchurian rule grew in the late 19th century. The political programme of the revolutionary Dr Sun Yat-sen (孫逸仙 Sun Yixian / 孫中山 Sun Zhongshan), who fought for the overthrow of the Manchurian monarchy of the Qing dynasty, gradually gained increasing popular support. His political ideals were summed up in a doctrine called the ""Three People's Principles"" 三民主義 (nationalism, democracy and national welfare), which aspired to an independent and democratic China. On 10 October 1911 (Xinhai Revolution 辛亥革命), Sun's military forces successfully captured the capital of Hubei province, Wuchang, and proclaimed secession from the Manchurian Qing dynasty. The revolution gradually engulfed the whole of central and southern China. These rebellious, south-central provinces declared independence and established an independent republic with Nanjing as its capital. The provisional government of the newly established Republic of China, headed by Sun Yatsen (his official enthronement as President on 1 January 1912 is considered as the founding day of the Republic of China and is still celebrated in Taiwan today), was very weak as the northern provinces were still loyal to the Manchurian Empire. In order to preserve national unity and avoid civil war, Sun renounced the presidency and offered it to the Northern Army General Yuan Shikai 袁世凱, who on 12 February 1912 obtained the abdication of the last Manchurian Emperor, Xuantong 宣統皇帝 (Puyi), ending the reign of the last dynasty in China. The Republic of China thus became the legitimate heir to the Qing territory, which at that time included Xinjiang, Tibet, Mongolia, and Manchuria (Taiwan was then still under Japan). Yuan Shikai soon disappointed the revolutionaries greatly. Instead of democracy and social reform, he sought to establish a new dynasty and the imperial throne, and to destroy the Party, thus completely flouting the Constitution of the Republic. Sun Yatsen therefore reorganised his alliance (the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance 中國同盟會) into the Chinese Nationalist Party 國 民 黨 (KMT). After a failed attempt at revolution again, he relocated to Japan, where he continued the revolution until Yuan's death in 1916. In 1917, he returned to Guangzhou and worked to reunite a completely fragmented China ruled by military strongmen. He founded the famous Huangpu 黃埔 (Whampoa) military academy, which became a centre for raising a revolutionary army to reunify China. After Sun's death (1925), General Chiang Kai-shek (蔣中正 Jiang Zhongzheng / 蔣介石 Jiang Jieshi) took supreme command of the army. In his famous three-year military expedition to northern China, Chiang defeated many feudal lords and annexed the military provinces to the rule of the Republic of China. In March 1927, Nanjing was restored as the capital of the Republic of China, and with the capture of Beijing in 1928, Chiang triumphantly completed the Northern Expedition. Power over China thus passed to the Nationalists, but unification did not bring lasting peace. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), founded in 1921 and initially working with Chiang, was gaining more and more strength, and the ideological tensions between the two parties were becoming increasingly insurmountable. China was increasingly threatened by the danger of a Japanese invasion. <p/> Japan launched an attack on Manchuria in 1931, establishing a puppet state known as Manzhuguo 滿洲國. The last emperor of the Qing dynasty, Puyi, was chosen as the formal leader. For reasons of national interest, the Communists and Nationalists then reunited to fight the Japanese forces, but the cooperation was merely symbolic and there was no genuine truce between the two factions. The incident between Japanese and Chinese troops at the Marco Polo Bridge near Beijing in 1937 led to the Second Sino-Japanese War, which lasted for eight years, until the end of the Second World War. After the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which ignited the Second World War, the Republic of China, which was on the side of the Allies, played the role of an important war front, receiving massive American aid. At the end of 1943, a declaration (the Cairo Declaration) was signed in Cairo by US President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and General Chiang Kaishek, in which the return of Manchuria, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands was assigned to the Republic of China. The Japanese surrender and the Postdam Declaration adopted in August 1945 gave legitimacy to the Cairo Declaration. The departure of the Japanese forces, however, refocused all the energies of the communists and nationalists on the battle for their own power. This gave the Chinese civil war full momentum. <p/>Republic of China power <p/> After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, the Nationalist ROK army, on behalf of the Allied Powers, invaded Taiwan and accepted the Japanese surrender. On 25 October 1945, Taiwan officially became part of the Republic of China. <p/> White Terror 白色恐怖 1945-1972 <p/> The Taiwanese people were very happy to see the restoration of ties with the mainland, the departure of the Japanese army and the arrival of representatives of the Nationalist ROK government. However, relations between the Taiwanese people and the new immigrants from the Chinese mainland soon became strained. The priority of the ROC government was the conquest of the whole of China, while Taiwan and the local population were not of paramount importance to the government of the time. The early period of the ROC government in Taiwan was marked by corruption, illegal land grabbing, inflation, outbreaks of infectious diseases and shortages of basic goods. All of this consequently led to one of Taiwan's greatest tragedies: the 228 二二八事件 Incident. The incident took place on 27 February 1947, when a woman illegally selling untaxed cigarettes on a street in Taipei was attempted to be punished by a group of police officers and agents of the Monopoly Bureau. The scuffle ended in a shoot-out in which a Taiwanese bystander was killed. Immediately, tensions arose between the discriminated civilian population on the one hand and the KMT civil servants on the other. <p/> The conflicts escalated into mass demonstrations, all of which were suppressed in blood. Thousands of Taiwanese, mainly educated people, were killed by government forces at the time. Although repression in the later period did not reach the level of 1947, political arrests and detentions were commonplace in Taiwan until the early 1970s. This period has therefore earned the name ""beil terror"". The incident planted the seeds of hatred between the locals and the newcomers, with far-reaching consequences for Taiwanese society. The newcomers made up only 15 % of the island's population, but for many years they maintained their superiority over the 85-strong native population. It was not until 1995 that the ROC-Nationalist Party government, headed by President Lee Teng-hui (李登輝 Li Denghui), formally apologised for the repression and passed a law to compensate all victims of the terror, declaring 28 February a public holiday two years later. <p/>ROC government relocation to Taiwan <p/> In 1949, the Nationalist troops in China were finally defeated. To escape the Communists, Chiang Kai-shek and his government took refuge in Taiwan with some 1.5 million supporters, where he established a new base for the R.C. On 1 October, Mao Zedong, the commander of the Communist troops, solemnly proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in Tiananmen Square. Thus was born the ""two Chinas"". Both governments, the PRC and the ROC, asserted their legitimacy over the territory of the whole of China. With the support of the USA, the ROC, as the legitimate representative of the whole of China, established close diplomatic relations with most of the democratic countries of the world and retained its seat at the United Nations until 1971, when the international situation turned in favour of the PRC. During this period, however, the political and economic development of the island, independent of the PRC, gradually transformed the Taiwanese people's self-conception of their identity and belonging.",Information/Explanation
"Lukšič does not expect Janša and Janković to take ""radical measures"" <p/> Ljubljana, 08 January (STA) - SD President Igor Lukšič believes that the findings of the anti-corruption commission regarding their assets should make Prime Minister and SDS President Janez Janša and PS President Zoran Janković think twice and then do ""what the majority expects"".Lukšič also believes that the SD President and SDS President Janez Janša and the PS President Zoran Janković should rethink the matter. But he said it was difficult to expect them to decide on ""any radical measures"". <p/> It is very bad for Slovenia that we have two people at the top of Slovenian politics who ignore the practice we want to introduce in the country, i.e. that politicians have transparent finances, that they are able to explain where their income comes from, and if they are not able to do so, that they leave their posts, Lukšič said in response to the findings of the anti-corruption commission. <p/> He hopes that ""this is the drop over the edge that will finally mean the introduction of a new practice in Slovenian politics"".

First, he says, they both have to make the right move, and only then will there be time to think about the way forward. <p/> He adds that ""there is no point in getting ahead of ourselves, because unfortunately experience shows that in such situations, people in Slovenia have so far, as a rule, not decided to do what they should have done"". <p/> What is important for Slovenia, he says, is to get a government that is credible. Lukšič points out that the government has 18% support and that this is a key problem. He also problematises the fact that a government with 18% support is going to sell Slovenian assets. ""We simply know that this will not be done credibly, it cannot be,"" he concludes. <p/> "" If these deals are run by people who cannot explain how 200 000 came into their account, how will they be able to explain where these huge billions will go. 12 billion are at stake,"" the SD leader added. <p/> The Anti-Corruption Commission found that SDS President Janez Janša and Positivna Slovenije President Zoran Janković had violated anti-corruption legislation when auditing the assets of party presidents. According to the Commission, Janković failed to declare assets worth at least €2.4 million, and part of the financial inflows into his personal bank account came from a chain of transactions that started in Grep. As for Janša, he notes that his assets have inexplicably increased by €210,000.",News

"VIRUSES IN CHILDREN <p/> Winter time and cold temperatures are the perfect opportunity for some viruses to spread quickly. These include viruses that cause gastrointestinal infections. The most common causes of intestinal infections in childhood are rotaviruses. Intestinal infection is manifested by diarrhoea and vomiting, nausea, cramps and fever. <p/> CAUSERS <p/> The most common causes of diarrhoea in childhood are viruses, rotaviruses being the most common. Rotavirus infections occur every year, all year round, although more people are usually ill during the cold months. During these months, rotaviruses cause infection mainly in children up to 2 years of age.Entericadenoviruses cause diarrhoea and fever lasting for several days, with or without vomiting, in infants and young children, and may be accompanied by signs of a common cold. Of the bacterial agents, Salmonella and Campylobacter infections are the most common, and diarrhoea can also be caused by parasites. <p/> SYMPTOMS <p/> The typical clinical picture of a child with a gastrointestinal tract infection is defecation and vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, headache and muscle pain. The problems last for a day or two. A child with a gastrointestinal infection, vomiting and diarrhoea loses quite a lot of fluid and electrolytes. Fluid loss is also increased by fever and sweating and rapid breathing. Insufficient fluid intake can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances in the blood. <p/> Signs of dehydration include: thirst, dry mouth, bright red lips, sore eyes, less urination. Then the child may become markedly tired or irritable, breathing is deep and rapid, as is the heart rate. In a dehydrated baby, the large lobe of the head drops, the urine may be darker and smaller in volume, the baby becomes more drowsy or irritable. Such a condition definitely requires immediate medical attention. <p/> TRANSMISSION OF INFECTION <p/> Infection spreads easily between children because even a small number of viruses are enough to make a person infected and ill. Viruses are transmitted by contact with an infected person, by touching toys or surfaces that have viruses on them, or by eating contaminated food or drink. When a child is ill, viruses are shed in high concentrations in the faeces for a few days to 14 days, or longer. During this time, apparently healthy children are infectious to the surrounding area. <p/> TREATMENT <p/> Fluid and electrolyte replacement is very important in gastrointestinal viral infections. The child should drink plenty of fluids (tea, isotonic drinks, soups, etc.) several times a day, in small amounts, and fizzy drinks are discouraged. Various oral rehydration solutions are also available in pharmacies. If the child is breastfed, breastfeeding should be continued. As this is a viral and not a bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract, the infection should not be treated with antibiotics. <p/> WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR <p/> A child with an intestinal infection loses quite a lot of fluid and electrolytes through vomiting and diarrhoea. This loss is also increased by fever and sweating and rapid breathing. Therefore, insufficient fluid intake can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances in the blood. A doctor should be seen if the condition does not improve after two days.A doctor's visit is also necessary for dehydration. <p/> PREVENTING TRANSMISSION <p/> Frequent and correct hand washing is very important. In particular after using the toilet or changing nappies, and before preparing food and before eating, hand washing should be regular and thorough. Foods eaten without pre-cooking should be thoroughly cleaned with hygienic water. Children attending kindergarten or school should return to the collective at least 24 hours after the cessation of diarrhoea or vomiting, preferably after three days. <p/> DOES CEPIVO exist? <p/> There is a vaccine against rotavirus infection. It is not given by injection, but is injected into the mouth. Two or three doses are needed, with at least 4 weeks between each dose. It is intended for young children from 6 weeks to 6 months of age. There are insufficient data on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in older children. Research to date has shown that protection against rotavirus infection by vaccination lasts for at least 2 years.",Information/Explanation
"Additional content <p/> SIPINA E-Reader <p/> The SIPINA-E-Reader system provides voice-controlled e-services for the interactive delivery/reading of information for users with disabilities (especially the blind and visually impaired). The SIPINA-E-Reader system is able to recognise the speech of users (speech commands and supported speech management) and enables the delivery of information in the form of speech. It connects to the SIPINA cloud-based system via a WiFi connection. <p/> The figure shows the functional architecture of the SIPINA system. The system is based on the concept of distributed processing and technology clouds. The main guiding principles of the SIPINA system architecture are: <p/> The SIPINA system includes several core technologies, which are system- and application-independent: <p/> ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), <p/> TTS (Automatic Speech Synthesis), <p/> SDS (Speech-Driven Dialogue System).<p/> The SIPINA system includes several core technologies, which are system- and application-independent: <p/> ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), <p/> TTS (Automatic Speech Synthesis), SDS (Speech-Driven Dialogue System). <p/> Structure of the SIPINA-E-SPEAKER system <p/> Technical characteristics of the SIPINA-E-SPEAKER system <p/> SIPINA-E-SPEAKER enables a high quality and efficient delivery of speech modality services. SIPINA-E-SPEAKER consists of a Java GUI and several modules that provide the necessary operation and communication with the SIPINA system: for audio, the tcp/ip protocol, and the RTSP/MRCP communication protocol. For all interaction, the user needs nothing more than a microphone image. The microphone colouring and the audio signal signal the user when the system expects a response from him. While the system is playing the system message or information requested by the user, the microphone is inactive and does not allow control by the user. This ensures that the system speech is not recognised as user speech, which can be a problem with mobile terminals. <p/> The SIPINA-E-RECORDER is designed as a TCP/IP client. It consists of software to run on Android, Blackberry mobile phones, and also platforms such as tablets. The system is based on the Java programming language for mobile terminals. SIPINA-E-BRALNIK allows remote reading of information, if possible connecting to a WiFi network. The functional specification of the software is given in this document. The functionality of the individual modules is also described. <p/> SIPINA-E-RADER dialogue <p/> The dialogue in the SIPINA-E-RADER system is system-managed. The system defines the individual dialogue states and offers the user a set of choices in each dialogue state. The user can select from the given choices and thus determine the further course of the dialogue. The system messages, which are played to the user by the system in the form of voice messages, provide the user with all the necessary information to choose the continuation of the dialogue (self-declared system messages). The user can determine the continuation of the dialogue by speaking individual words or short phrases. The system messages include instructions on which words the user can use to continue the dialogue in a certain dialogue state. <p/> The user of the SIPINA E-BRALNIK system can choose between the following news sources: Radiotelevizija Slovenija, 24ur, Delo, Hefajst. For the selected source, the user can select the news areas covered by each source. The names of the areas for the selected source are transmitted by the system to the user in the form of a system voice message. At the same time, the speech recognition system's grammar (the set of words that the speech recognition system can recognise) is adapted to allow the recognition of the words of the areas of the selected source. The headline of the first news item of the selected source is then played after the selected area. The user can initiate the reading of a news item by saying the word ""read"" or the reading of the title of the next news item by saying the word ""next"". The user can trigger the reading of the title of the previous news by pronouncing the word ""back"". In each dialogue state, he/she can choose to move to another area (pronounced 'another area') or another source (pronounced 'another source').

"The Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre of the Franciscans of Kamnik, located in a corridor next to the presbytery of the monastery church, is a unique piece of Plečnik's art, full of symbolism. The plans for it were drawn up in 1952 and it was completed in 1954. More... <p/> The monastery chapel was used as a prayer room and for the installation of the Nativity scene and the Holy Sepulchre. The architect was assisted by the local pater Martin Perc. Previously, Plečnik had rebuilt the church in Stranja and planned the baptistery in Nevlje on the orders of Father Perc. Plečnik stripped the plaster from the stonework in the chapel and emphasised the intermediate joints. The stone wall is connected to the lower edge of the plastered surface by a corrugation, which has the function of a seam. On the altar table stands a monolithic tabernacle made of underbaked brick, with stone and brass candlesticks on either side of the tabernacle. Behind the tabernacle is a luminous circular screen. The ceiling is a timber structure made of logs, supported on timber lintels on timber cantilevers. Three chandeliers are fixed on each side of the sloping beams under the logs. This is the theme of the tent, which Plečnik took from the famous mid-19th century German architect and theorist Semper. The walls and ceiling are executed in the architect's characteristic late-period sgraffito technique. Inscriptions, symbols of Christ's martyrdom and geometric borders are included. The window looking into the church has a pair of double polished dark marble mullions on each side. Opposite the altar, a figure of the Crucified is mounted on an alabaster slab in a T-shaped frame. The handle on the door is in the form of a stylised dove. The chapel's furnishings contain a great deal of symbolism. Small metal lights, which some believe resemble military helmets, are arranged around the ceiling. They radiate a short beam of light upwards, giving the appearance of a starry sky. The beams on the ceiling of the altar part suggest the stable or manger of Christ, while the monolithic tabernacle symbolises the rock tomb of Christ. Thus, the cycle of Christ's birth, death and resurrection is symbolically completed. <p/> Dr. Andreja Eržen, historian, Director of the Agency for the Development of Tourism and Entrepreneurship in the Municipality of Kamnik, spoke on camera about the furnishings of the monastery chapel.",Information/Explanation
"I propose to the Government of Slovenia that, in the event of any illiquidity or insolvency, it should call in a popular loan of EUR 5 billion at 5% interest per annum. The moratorium on payment is 5 years and then payment of principal and interest in 5 annual instalments. <p/> The above-mentioned People's Loan shall be duly presented in the mass media and in all media in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia and citizens shall be called upon to do their utmost to help preserve the financial sovereignty of the country. <p/> All citizens of the Republic of Slovenia and all legal entities with their registered office in the Republic of Slovenia are eligible to contribute. <p/> We know from the past that we have already had similar people's loans (the Skopje earthquake, the Austro-Hungarian road loan, the famous war loans, etc.). <p/> Having said that, I would like to point out that the first way to save the banks is to sell their own assets (redundant offices, business premises, union tourism facilities in spas and by the sea and in the mountains) and to pledge and secure the claims of legal and natural persons (flats, houses, businesses, etc.), and then the state should come to the rescue. It is also necessary to limit the salaries of managers in all state-owned companies and institutions to no more than the salary of the President of the country, the Prime Minister... No one can have more, least of all the quasi-experts. For example, the director of NKBM last year reported an annual income of over 270 000 euros, the bank is in the red, Mr Kramar from Izlak has a 1 million euro bonus for 5 years of management plus salary, and NLB has almost 2 billion bad loans, which it is utopian to believe will ever be repaid. If we are playing such games and delusional thinking, all the measures taken by the government and the savings made by all the employees are meaningless. Or the recently published report by the Court of Auditors that the investment in 2 blocks for 170 prisoners at Dob Prison has risen from EUR 6 million to EUR 87 million. Of course, no one will be held accountable, and we will not show the door to any of the 'experts'. It just happens. As long as we do, we will be in for a dive. Do you remember that the Yugoslav Royal Government fled to London in 1941 with tens of tonnes of the country's gold reserves. Today, of course, I do not mean the government, which is doing its best (a few years too late, unfortunately, because we all dreamt of a success story), but individual entrepreneurs, managers and directors. Where will you go, gentlemen? <p/> When the Austrian lands (of which today's Slovenia was a part) were threatened by the Turkish menace, they took away the bells and the silver and gold mass chalices and ritual utensils from the churches, they burned the mass coats in which the gold and silver threads were knitted, they introduced an anti-Turkish tax. The Tlacian Raj, as well as the local feudal lords, groaned under the weight of the burden imposed on them by the imperial office in Vienna. But we escaped the Turkish threat and the Ottoman yoke, with enormous human and material losses that would be felt for decades and centuries to come. So today, if we come together as we did in 1991, we are able to preserve the financial sovereignty of the R.S.S.R. Look, Greece has received and will receive more than €100 billion in aid (I don't know how it will pay it back, probably never! ). Its richest citizens alone have almost €200 billion invested in foreign banks. No comment is needed here. <p/> For me, the financial sovereignty of our country is not something that I would be prepared to sacrifice for. I am sure that the gentlemen from Brussels will manage our money better than our politicians do. As for the Greeks and their money, they are usually successful businessmen, and they are by no means stupid enough to buy in bulk the bonds of a country that is likely to go bankrupt within a few months. <p/> There are more than enough funds in the accounts of R Slovenia residents to sort things out (at least for now! ) on our own without asking for foreign help. But our citizens also have bank accounts in banks in Austria, Liechtenstein, etc. If everyone contributes as much as they can, the matter is solved. We can also guarantee our citizens the eventual sale of Telekom, Petrol, etc., so that they know that they will get their money back in any case. Bonds could be subscribed for at the counters of banks, post offices, administrative units, etc. This is not quite the same as buying treasury bills and the like. With my proposal, we would be buying our country's financial independence and, therefore, our future. Why have money in a sock or in the bank at 2% interest and know that you have done something good for yourself, your children and the whole country of R Slovenia by paying into the People's Loan. That's how it is. This should be an all-Slovenian action, like the signing of the May Day Declaration or something similar during the Austro-Hungarian period. But as I said, no one in state-owned or majority state-owned companies can have a salary higher than the President of the Republic, the Government, etc. (that's 65 pay grade). If we do not solve this problem too, we will have done nothing. There will always be leeches who will try to suckle at the state teat. I would not discuss the professionalism of these gentlemen, otherwise we would not be where we are, which is nowhere. The way they have run things, they would be any economics graduate who takes up his first job as a trainee. I think that he would have been driven by his profession and the professional challenge, whereas these gentlemen were driven solely by the drive for money. <p/> The Government regularly issues bonds. Any EU citizen or company can open a company here and buy the bonds mentioned in the proposal. So they would be no different from other bonds. This government, which is now ""trying its best"", has only recently blocked the much-needed reforms of the previous government through referendums.... in some cases practically the same laws as it is now proposing. Let's not forget this.... Given the way our politicians view the benefit of the state, in fact, coercive administration by Brussels seems to me to be a better idea by the day. As much damage as our own politicians are doing to us, those in Brussels certainly will not do it.",Opinion/Argumentation

"Digital Marketing Essentials and Activities <p/> Today, it's harder than ever to stand out from all the competition. But you've never had as much chance of success as you do today. With all the options available, choosing services and tactics is an even more complex task. Strategically planned, results-oriented activities, a smart digital strategy with the optimal combination and design of solutions, tactics and campaigns, will deliver surprising results, especially for companies that are just starting to approach digital marketing professionally, strategically, comprehensively and purposefully, with thoughtful and modern results-oriented approaches. <p/> Due to the many myths, inaccurate or misleading claims, innovations on the one hand, and the real opportunities in digital marketing on the other, companies, individuals and even ""experts"" are still too often making superficial choices about where to focus their energy and resources. Providers often offer what they know how to do, rather than what customers actually need. That's why in the following lines we take a closer look at the basic activities of digital marketing, and the details that set effective digital strategies apart from the crowd of mediocre ones. <p/> 1. An engaging and responsive mobile-friendly website <p/> Your website has long since ceased to be just a business card. It's your central online presence and your company's first salesperson. No one employee can do it. That's why you need a bespoke website that generates new business and customers under any circumstances. In today's digital reality, more and more of us are accessing and interacting with brands via smartphones and tablets, so it's vital that visitors are able to view your website and content in a unified, personalised way across all devices. The user experience on the site must be just as efficient, equally and quickly transparent, and everything must be in its place, whether the content is accessed on a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer. Those of you who are still neglecting mobile technology, flexible display methods and customers in the moments when they have their phone in their hand may long regret it, because you are neglecting them in those intimate moments when the deepest connection with your followers, potential customers and readers can be made. <p/> 2. Website optimisation and search marketing for lead generation <p/> Anyone who thinks that SEO no longer exists, or no longer delivers the right results, has a bad sense of humour. Search engine optimisation is alive and well, now more than ever, as long as it is adapted to new SEO methods. It is, however, much more difficult to implement than in the past, thanks to Google's sophisticated, sometimes annoying, search algorithm, which is being refined on a daily basis. Together with on-page optimisation, online advertising on search engines (e.g. Google AdWords) allows us to attract more new customers more easily and more quickly. All digital marketing activities must also be continuously monitored using web analytics tools, data collated, analysed and your website optimisation strategy continuously updated. <p/> 3. Email marketing <p/> It is amazing how many people still turn a blind eye to the usefulness and effectiveness of email marketing. Even though we are already in 2017, sending emails to your target audience has always been one of the more effective tactics to increase traffic and conversions on your website. We also call email marketing the ""evergreen of digital marketing"". In addition to its direct impact on sales, email marketing plays an even more important role in building and nurturing a loyal follower base that is ""fed"" with content, which in turn increases repeat purchases and subsequent conversions. <p/> Just think how many emails you receive in your inbox every day. But do you think there would really be that much if it didn't work? <p/> Of course, our goal and yours is not to fill inboxes all the time, but sending targeted messages to a segmented population (who have given permission) works wonders. The need to automate all these processes also makes it necessary to use tools and integrate email marketing and other databases, tools. For all of you who have not yet integrated email marketing into your business, you have now learned where you have been making a basic mistake all this time. <p/> 4. Using social networks <p/> Today, people find it difficult to trust and are overwhelmed with information, questions, obligations; but we are demanding and informed customers who make decisions and buy emotionally. We strive to have and achieve everything at the click of a button or a click. The reality is not so simple. Our decision-making is also influenced by our relationships with people, brand representatives, their support service, the information given and other subliminal brand messages. <p/> Social networks are a place where we can manage all of this and delight our followers with expected or unexpected attention, replies, interesting content, rewards to reinforce our brand and showcase our values. If we implement all of the above effectively up to this point, our social media activities will only further expand and strengthen our visibility and recognition. <p/> 5. Content marketing as a link <p/> The link between a smart and successful digital marketing strategy is the content strategy and the publishing calendar. Thus, content marketing, blog articles, images, infographics, e-books, videos, reports, etc., represent an increasing share of digital marketing investment. How could they not, when digital content has become the most important means of communication today. There are more and more reasons to plan, organise and produce content that wins the hearts of readers according to a specific publishing calendar.

"Ordinary Woman (Written by Danaja Lorenčič) <p/> In the eyes of ten year old, twenty year old and even thirty year old Danaja, I was burned at the stake in my quest to become something special. <p/> Danaja Lorenčič <p/> A few weeks ago, I was invited for coffee by a friend I rarely see. But while talking to her, I immediately got that familiar feeling that reminds me again and again why I love some people so much. Because they don't hide behind a mask of perfection, they don't feel ashamed of their vulnerability, they don't get defensive when they are in need, and they don't resort to cynicism when you touch their wounds during a conversation. <p/> Before we had each had our cup of coffee, she told me that she had been searching for her own identity lately, as she had lost herself in the last few years due to her many roles. She was starting to wonder who she was if she wasn't a mother and a wife who went to work and in her spare time was a musician. It touched me when she confessed that one of her greatest fears was to become an ordinary woman, so she kept up her hobbies, even when she no longer enjoyed them, because she was afraid that without them she would slip into a boring routine and turn into an uninteresting person. How I recognised myself in her words! I don't have any hobbies, because I have turned what I enjoy most into my work (i.e. writing), but I identified with her fear of the ordinary. Suddenly, hundreds of scenes swirled in my head, reminding me of all I had done to escape the image of the ordinary woman I feared almost as much as my own death. <p/> To avoid becoming ordinary, I kept my weight low and for a short time even believed that anorexia made me special. To avoid becoming ordinary, I rejected the idea of a serious relationship for years because I thought that being single was something that only independent, strong women could do. To avoid becoming ordinary, I dreamt for a very, very long time of a singing career that would save me from an ordinary life, paying bills and annoying bosses. To avoid becoming ordinary, I hung out with damaged people who, like me, refused to grow up for a long time. To avoid becoming ordinary, I gave up my first and only regular job. To avoid becoming ordinary, I gave up any thought of motherhood by the age of thirty-five. <p/> Of all the things I did to escape from ordinariness, there is only one thing I do not regret - that I gave up a job that did not make me the least bit happy. Which is not to say that I was entirely happy about it afterwards, as I swallowed the bitter experience of precarious work. But I took responsibility for that decision and faced it. Because by giving up a secure job, I was not running away from discomfort, I was throwing myself out of my comfort zone and starting to develop my potential within my discomfort zone. <p/> This made me feel special, and I tried to escape the fate of the ordinary woman in other areas of my life. I decided that I wanted to write for a living and convinced myself that this was only possible if I didn't have a partner to start a family with, as this would certainly hinder me from achieving my goals. I was operating under the mindset: If I want to be special, I have to give up what is typical of most people. <p/> In reality, I was scared of love after the love wrecks that had caused me emotional wounds. I was scared to let go of control of my weight because I thought I would lose control of my life. I was afraid to end destructive relationships with people who hated themselves because I was afraid they would hate me too. And I was terrified of becoming a mother - especially if I gave birth to a baby girl, because I knew that I would be a bad role model for her because of my unprocessed pain, my denial of pleasure, my tendency to abuse myself and to repress my emotions. <p/> If I take a closer look at my life, which is something of a ritual for me this week as I celebrate my 38th birthday, it is certainly different and in some ways much less special than I imagined it would be. <p/> For me, being special meant creating a life that did not involve complicated emotions, arguments, sharing household responsibilities with a partner and parenthood. <p/> Hearing my friend say that she was afraid of being ordinary made me think about how I had misinterpreted specialness and at the same time had an unjustified fear of being ordinary. Because back then, when I was striving for specialness, I was nowhere near as content and at peace as I am now. <p/> If I take a closer look at my life, which for me is a kind of obligatory ritual this week as I celebrate my 38th birthday, it is certainly different and in some ways much less special than I imagined it would be. I am no longer obsessed with controlling my weight. I have not become a famous singer or a successful writer. I have not stayed single so that I can create uninterrupted. I do not have many friends, because I have distanced myself from those who used to burden me with their darkness. And I did not give up motherhood so that I did not have to change anything about myself that I was not proud of. <p/> In the eyes of ten-year-old, twenty-year-old and even thirty-year-old Danaja, I was burnt out in my efforts to become something special. But in the eyes of Danaja, who is slowly approaching forty, I see peace. <p/> And that is what I have longed for for years. For an inner peace that I have wrongly called an ordinary life.",Opinion/Argumentation
"Nicotine addiction <p/> Nicotine addiction is a complex phenomenon that depends primarily on the absorption and metabolism of nicotine. In addition to sociological factors, our genetic make-up has a particularly important influence, as it can explain more than 50 % of the total risk of nicotine dependence. <p/> Scientists are discovering new genes with smaller effects alongside the well-known genes with large effects, such as CHRNA3, which have contributed significantly to understanding the biological mechanism of addiction. Nicotine acts on the acetylcholine receptor family in the brain because it is structurally similar to the brain chemical carrier acetylcholine. Binding of nicotine to such a receptor triggers the opening of ion channels on the cell membrane and the release of new neurotransmitters in the brain that induce feelings of pleasure. Chronic exposure to nicotine causes changes in the receptors, which can become less sensitive or even inactive. Changes also occur in the metabolism of nerve cells. All these changes can cause a smoker to fall into a withdrawal crisis when he or she stops smoking. <p/> More details on nicotine dependence <p/> Add to these facts the link between smoking and heart attack, lung disease and cancers of the tongue, throat and lungs, and you have enough reasons to quit. However, this is often where a major problem arises. The World Health Organisation estimates that less than 5% of people who have tried to quit smoking unaided persist one year after their last cigarette. This is due to nicotine dependence influenced by genetic factors. <p/> Nicotine dependence is a complex phenomenon that depends, among other things, on nicotine absorption and metabolism. Different people react very differently to the same amount of nicotine, which is determined by genetic factors. They can explain more than 50 of the risks of nicotine dependence.

"Strong outburst in the sun ! <p/> The activity of the Sun is of growing importance to humanity as we are increasingly dependent on global connections, the vast majority of which are via satellites. The Earth is shielded from the flow of material from the Sun by a magnetic field. <p/> However, in the event of a major flare, some particles will slip through and hit the Earth's atmosphere, which can affect surface infrastructure during so-called geomagnetic storms. The Earth is shielded from the flow of material from the Sun by its magnetic field. However, in stronger eruptions, some particles slip through and hit the Earth's atmosphere. What is the risk of this happening ? <p/> (Dr Primož Kajdič -)These outbursts, and if the conditions are right, then some of these particles may indeed enter the Earth's ionosphere or atmosphere, especially near the north and south magnetic poles. Then these particles, because they have very high energy, cause radiation and we then see this as the aurora borealis. The second thing that happens is that the Earth's magnetic field changes dramatically and this is then called a geomagnetic storm. But in general, changes in the Earth's magnetic field due to external solar winds and other phenomena, what we call space weather, are also felt on Earth. They can cause damage to our electrical wiring, our satellites can also burn up, stop working, astronauts' lives could be in danger, and so on. Such phenomena have occurred in the past. Then, with every solar cycle, we move more and more into space, more and more dependent on the technology that is in space. In the future, it will be very important to study these phenomena on the Sun and in the solar wind, because we will be more and more sensitive to them. We will need to find out how we can protect ourselves against them in order to minimise the damage. <p/> One more thing about the Sun itself. <p/> The Sun contains 99.8% of the mass of the Solar System. The rest of the mass is mostly found in Jupiter, with only a small fraction shared by all the other celestial bodies in the Solar System. The Sun is a perfectly average G2 star. In size, it is one of the 10% largest stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which is made up of around 100 billion stars. The average size of stars in the Milky Way is less than 50% of the size of the Sun. <p/> The present Sun is made up of 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and the rest is all other chemical elements. The Sun is slowly converting hydrogen into helium. This releases various waves which are detected on Earth as heat, light and various radiations. The Sun rotates on its axis. But because it is a big gaseous ball, its parts rotate at different speeds. It makes one revolution every 25.4 days at the equator and one every 36 days at the poles. It has a core in the centre that is 25% of its total diameter. The core rotates uniformly and behaves like a solid body. The surface of the core is under hellish conditions. The core has a surface temperature of 15.6 million Kelvin and a pressure of 250 billion atmospheres. The fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium nuclei produces a huge energy of 386 billion billion kilowatts every second. Thus, every second, 700 million tonnes of hydrogen are transformed into 695 million tonnes of helium. 5 million tonnes per second are gamma rays penetrating through the solar mantle to the photosphere. The photosphere is the surface of the Sun that we can see. As it travels through the sun's mantle, the strength of the radiation is reduced as it returns to the core. Some of the radiation just reaches the edge of the photosphere and flies off the Sun as visible light and thermal radiation. The temperature of the photosphere is 5800 degrees Kelvin. Sometimes we see darker sunspots on the surface, these have a temperature of 3800 degrees Kelvin. Sunspots are formed by the influence of the Sun's magnetic field. However, the way they are formed has not yet been satisfactorily explained. Above the photosphere, there is a thin chromosphere. Above this is the extremely thin corona. This extends millions of kilometres into space. It is visible at solar eclipse as a brilliant ring. The temperatures of the gases in it can reach up to a million degrees Kelvin. <p/> The Sun's magnetic field is extremely strong and extends far beyond Pluto. At the edge of this field is thought to lie the Oort Cloud of icy celestial bodies, the outermost edge of our Solar System. As well as heat and light, the Sun also emits a faint stream of electrified particles. These are mainly electrons and protons. These are called the solar wind. The Sun radiates them at a steady 450 km/second. Only when there are large outbursts, visible as giant flares or protuberances, does the intensity of the solar wind increase. Sunspots and prominences occur on a fairly regular 11-year cycle. But the solar wind affects the paths of artificial satellites, pushing them further and further off course. It pushes lighter particles out of icy celestial bodies, comets, and forms their tails. In larger outbursts, solar wind particles also hit the Earth's magnetic field. This brings it closer to the surface and the solar wind particles hit particles in the Earth's atmosphere. This creates the coloured aurora borealis, or northern lights. The particles are also dangerous to humans and astronauts must wear protective clothing. In the event of a major outbreak, they must take refuge in specially protected areas of the space station. It would be possible to build a spaceship with a sail that uses the steady pressure of the solar wind for propulsion. <p/> The Sun is 4.5 billion years old, the same age as our Solar System. Since its formation, it has consumed about 50% of the hydrogen. So they predict it will shine as brightly as ever for another 5 billion years. At the end of its lifetime, it will have expanded by half its present size. When it has used up all its hydrogen, it will radically change and swallow all its planets into itself.",Information/Explanation

Probably every one of us has a room in which we relax the best and easiest, and for me it's definitely my living room, which I have furnished to suit my needs. I remember that when I was buying a new living room, I spent an enormous amount of time, because I was quite a demanding buyer. Every man will probably agree that there is nothing better than half-lounging in front of the television in your living room and enjoying watching football, laughing while listening to politicians or simply watching one of the popular science channels. I have the habit of sometimes using my living room for reading, because I like to read a lot. It is also the case in our house that the living room is where we spend most of our time when we are not working, of course. But I am one of those people who does not like to visit my living room, because I am of the opinion that living rooms are in a way too private a place to invite friends into. After all, there is nothing more reassuring to me than being able to lie down in front of the television in my living room in just my underpants. <p/> Living room ideas <p/> Sometimes a friend asks me where I got the idea for my original living room.

Accommodation of workers who will work on the TEŠ 6 project 3. Under the first agenda item (Opening hours of restaurants in the municipality of Velenje), the Mayor of the Municipality of Velenje, Mr Bojan Kontič, presented the dilemmas that arise in connection with extending the opening hours of restaurants, because on the one hand, citizens want peace and quiet at night, and young people want open restaurants where they can have fun. Extended opening hours are, of course, also important for catering businesses for business reasons. According to the Catering Act, the approval of opening hours for catering establishments is the responsibility of the local authority, which can also withdraw or not grant approval at all. <p/> Catering establishments serving food and drink (restaurants, pubs, cafés, patisseries, cafeterias, snack bars and bars), located in buildings with flats or in buildings in a residential area intended for living and ancillary activities, may only operate between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Operating outside these hours shall be considered as extended opening hours, for which the caterer must obtain the written consent of the local authority. The relevant local authority shall decide on this on the basis of the adopted criteria laid down in the Rules on the criteria for determining the extended opening hours of catering establishments and farms catering in the municipality of Velenje. The Rules lay down the procedures and conditions for obtaining approval for extended opening hours, as well as the procedures and conditions for withdrawing such approval. The Municipal Regulation also obliges caterers to carry out their activities in such a way that they do not disturb the environment. <p/> According to Alenka Rednjak, Head of the Investment and Development Office, the Municipality of Velenje is in the process of amending the municipal regulations to provide that the opinion of the district or local community in whose area the restaurant is located is to be taken into account when issuing a consent for extended opening hours. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič informed the attendees that the Velenje Police Station had submitted two proposals to the Velenje Municipality for the cancellation of the extended opening hours, namely for Bar Max Klub, s.p. (Šaleška cesta 3, Velenje), where the opening hours are Monday to Thursday from 10 pm to 1 am and on Fridays and Saturdays from 10 pm to 5 am, and for Pit Stop bar (Celjska cesta 2, Velenje), where the bar is open 24 hours. According to the Velenje Police Station, the above-mentioned bars have had to intervene several times due to public order violations, including fights, and occasionally the detention of offenders. <p/> Drago Alenc, Commander of the Velenje Police Station, explained that due to the extended opening hours of the restaurants, problems and violations occur mainly in the vicinity of the Red Hall, where the restaurants are open until 3 or 5 am. Police officers note that after the closure of the Red Hall, guests go to the Pit Stop bar, which is across the road by the petrol station. For the safety of pedestrians on the road, police officers are repeatedly carrying out enhanced traffic controls on this stretch of road, as pedestrians are crossing the road in this part of the carriageway, which is not illuminated and in a place where there is no marked pedestrian crossing. Police officers note that many pedestrians are under the influence of alcohol. The Velenje Police Station considers that the frequent violations, which are mostly recorded at night on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, are a problem for public order, traffic and general safety in this part of the city. <p/> The Director of the Municipal Administration, Andreja Katič, pointed out that the request for more police officers should be re-submitted to the line ministry. <p/> The Mayor of Velenje, Bojan Kontič, said that on the basis of the proposal of the Velenje Police Station to cancel the extended opening hours of the Max Klub, s.p. bar and the Pit Stop bar, the Velenje Municipality had cancelled the consent for the extended opening hours of the above-mentioned establishments.<p/> The Mayor of Velenje, Bojan Kontič, said that the Municipality of Velenje had also cancelled the opening hours of the Max Klub, s.p. bar and the Pit Stop bar. The owner of the Pit stop bar appealed against the revocation of the consent and, following the new measures, provided more adequate security for the bar and was granted a new consent for extended opening hours by the municipality. However, Bar Max Klub, s.p., only has consent for extended opening hours at weekends, when concerts are held in the bar. <p/> The mayor pointed out that the municipality had not yet made a final decision on the issue of consents for extended opening hours for the bars in the Red Hall Velenje, as they wanted to find a compromise with the owners of the bars so that they could be open at night and at the same time would not violate the Act on Public Order and the Ordinance on General Order in the Municipality of Velenje. <p/> Under the second item on the agenda (Accommodation of workers to be employed in the TEŠ 6 project), the Director of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant Unit 6 Project, Mr. Miran Žgajner presented the project, which represents a new chapter in Slovenia's energy supply and is currently Slovenia's largest energy investment. It is a modern, highly efficient unit that will gradually replace the existing units. He stressed that Unit 6 is a replacement and not an additional generating facility, which is being built to provide more environmentally friendly electricity at a competitive price. The construction of Block 6 does not represent an additional encroachment on the site, as it will be built on the existing site. Of course, all the measures required by the Environmental Impact Report will also be implemented during construction. The construction of the 600 MW Block 6 will take until 2014. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič pointed out that the members of the Council, who act as a preventive body in this environment, would like to know in particular the number of workers who will be living in the valley during the construction of the block. In this way, the institutions could also prepare themselves for a larger number of clients. <p/> Mag. Mr Žgajner said that during the most intensive works, there would be between 1,500 and 1,800 workers on site, most of them foreigners. Those responsible for the construction of the unit have further increased security on site, as each worker will now have his or her own photo identification card. This will limit free movement on the site and ensure that workers can be properly identified off-site. In the coming days, Termoelektrarna Šoštanj will also conclude an agreement with PV Invest on mutual cooperation in organising accommodation for workers. <He added that road traffic to the construction site will be routed in such a way as to minimise disruption, and attempts will be made to bring as much material as possible by rail and at night. <p/> Mayor Bojan Kontič stressed the importance of the good cooperation of the Velenje Police Station and the Velenje Health Centre with those responsible for the Block 6 project. This is also due to the good and timely information provided to the police officers about the mode of transport of the cargo. The police officers ensure the safety of both our citizens and foreigners who come to work here. <p/> The Director of the Velenje Health Centre, Jože Zupančič, is negotiating with those in charge at Alstom about the provision of health services for foreigners coming to work in the valley. He said that the health centre will make sure that an emergency medical team will be available as close as possible to the construction site during the operating hours. A new doctor has also been recruited at the Šoštanj Health Station and will be available to deal with the expected increase in the number of patients. <p/> The Block 6 Project Director concluded by stressing that if the Government of the Republic of Slovenia does not adopt the Act on the State Guarantee for the Loans for Block 6 of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant by tomorrow, 15 February 2012, the Block 6 project may also come to a halt. <p/> Under Other Business, the Director of the Centre for Social Work Velenje, Zlatka Srdoč Majer, presented current information on the Centre's activities. It is encouraging to note that recently there have been fewer incidents of domestic violence and fewer applications for social assistance. However, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the new social organisation will have to wait until the end of March. By then, they expect to have issued all the decisions for 3 140 applicants.",News

"Events -> 2013 -> Parish Pilgrimage to Sladka Gora <p/> This year's pilgrimage route took us to Sladka Gora. <p/> A pilgrimage is a journey to the Lord, a walk on the stairs, increasing with each step the longing to touch the Heart and to rest in the Embrace. The soul is freed from the countless layers that bind and suffocate it, which is why the preparation for the Sacrament of Reconciliation is always so good for it. Ready to meet the Lord, we celebrated Holy Mass in the beautiful Baroque pilgrimage church of the Mother of God in Sladka Gora, Styria, with a men's choir made up of pilgrims singing. <p/> We were not only moved by the beautiful interior of the church, but also by the address of Pastor Andrew, who invited us to open our hearts to the point where we could ""be here"" with our whole being, soul and body, experiencing and fully accepting all that was placed before us; to forge bonds and friendships with people and with God. After the Holy Mass, the local parish priest gave us a historical outline of the Shrine and the life connected with it. <p/> The garden in front of the church was quite lively as the Oratory was taking place. <p/> We gathered again on the bus that took us to Šmarje pri Jelšah, where a good lunch was waiting for us. <p/> After lunch we went up to Calvary. The Way of Suffering, which leads to the pilgrimage church of St. Roko, is considered to be the most extensive Passion complex in Slovenia. It was built between 1743 and 1753. It leads the pilgrim between the chapels, so that he can always see only his next destination. Looking down into the valley, one sees the town and the unique image of the varied wine-growing landscape, from the border mountains of Styria and Carinthia to Pohorje, Boč and Donat, Macel and Zagorje in Croatia, to Bohorje, Hume and the Savinja Valley. <p/> Entering the Church of St. Roko, we had a new surprise. The massive exterior of the church, built in 1646, is in stark contrast to its richly decorated interior, where shell and net shapes, angel heads and flower branches intertwine. The pilgrimage tradition is still alive at St. Roch. On 15 August, the feast of the patron saint of the parish, Our Lady of the Assumption, and on 16 August, the feast of St. Rocco, several thousand people gather here. St. Rok is part of the pilgrimage triad, Sladka Gora - Tin Tin - St. Rok. The church is very acoustic, which is why concerts are held there. <p/> The first raindrops fell, and the bus took us to the most beautifully landscaped village in Europe, Olimje. <p/> Here we visited the Minorite monastery and learned about its history. <p/> In the Old Pharmacy we admired the frescoes by Anton Lerchinger, which speak of the path to health and happiness. We wandered into a shop with herbal preparations, teas, tinctures and ointments that help maintain health. We were overwhelmed by the image of the Pilgrimage House of St. Joseph and the park for rest and relaxation. We walked through the garden of medicinal plants where ""for every disease there is a flower"". The walking path leads between beds with around 200 specimens of medicinal plants named with Slovenian and Latin names, which grow in our gardens, meadows, marshes and forests, and are used for teas, salves and tinctures. Each plant is also labelled with its medicinal properties. <p/> In Olimje, we couldn't pass by the Chocolate Factory and its delicacies. We were drawn in, our eyes were big and our sweet tooth was irrepressible! <p/> At the end of our pilgrimage, in the beautiful Baroque pilgrimage church of the Assumption with its black and gold altars, we prayed the fifth Litany of the Mother of God and celebrated the National Day with a cultural programme in the courtyard of the monastery. <p/> On our way home, we passed through Trojany. Here we had a delicious doughnut or ice cream. We were happy and satisfied on our way back home, grateful to Pastor Andrew for leading and organising a wonderful pilgrimage that filled our hearts and souls. <p/> JP <p/> Photos.",Opinion/Argumentation
"Senica faces 10 years in prison for Delamaris <p/> A judicial inquiry has been opened at the Celje District Court in the Delamaris case. In the case, lawyer Mir Senić is accused of having wrongly received a commission of €1.3 million from Vegrad. <p/> Miro Senica, an influential Ljubljana lawyer, is officially under criminal investigation and faces up to ten years in prison. The lawyer is under investigation for alleged abuse of position and money laundering in the notorious Delamaris case, in which he allegedly received €1.3 million from Vegrad, reports today's Dnevnik daily. <p/> ""In this respect, we can only stress that Mr Miro Senica is convinced that all the suspicions against him are groundless and unfounded, which will undoubtedly be revealed when the investigation is completed,"" the law firm of Mr Senica told siol.net. <p/> Senica spent money on a villa in Portorož <p/> The controversial deal allegedly took place in 2007. Vegrad from Velenje bought the Delamaris fish processing plant in Isola for €22 million. The land was to be used for the Urban Renewal Izola project. Vegrad paid a commission of 1.35 million. This ended up in the account of Bužekijan, a company led by Blanka Muster, one of Senica's colleagues. In reality, the money ended up with Senica, who used it to buy a villa in Portorož. This is now owned by his daughter, Marusa Senica. <p/> In addition to Senica, the investigating judge will also question the former First Lady of Vegrad, Hilda Tovšak, the lawyer's daughter, Marusa Senica, as well as his colleagues Blanka Muster and Olga Zaviršek.",News
"Today, the Minister of Culture, Majda Širca, opened the exhibition Drawing in Slovenia II 1940-2009 at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) in Zagreb, which presents the works of around 100 Slovenian artists. It is a selection of drawings from the exhibition of the same name, which was held last year at the City Gallery of Ljubljana. <p/> Drawing is one of the most daring, challenging and exciting genres within the field of art, because it confronts us with a very demanding and responsible gesture that we must not miss, a gesture that is unique and which, on the other hand, is often a matrix, a basis or a point of departure for other artistic practices, Širčeva said about the importance of drawings. These, she believes, have been lost, especially today, in the many postmodernist artistic genres. <p/> She stressed the importance of the exhibition for Slovenian art, as well as the outstanding cooperation with Croatia in the field of culture. The Croatian Minister of Culture, Bozo Biskupic, also pointed out at the opening that the Slovenian exhibition is a celebration of community and mutual understanding. He recalled that the three giants of Slovenian and European art - Zoran Mušić, Gabriel Stupica and Marij Pregelj - are a symbol of a common cultural centre, having studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb. <p/> It is the drawings of this trio that open the exhibition, said its curator and art historian Aleksandar Bassin, who said that drawing has never been a trendy exclusive. The exhibition, he said, is arranged according to the artists' ages, not their works. After the three artists mentioned, the works of selected artists follow, from sculptors and printmakers to painters of the middle generation. <p/> In the last part of the exhibition, there are young people who were born in the 1970s or 1980s, and it is they who, according to Bassin, most express the future of drawing, which is consciously and unencumbered living its full artistic life. <p/> Until 21 September, drawings created in various artistic techniques will be on display, providing both a representative insight into Slovenian artistic drawing of the last 70 years and the continuity of drawing as an independent chapter of Slovenian fine art. <p/> The Zagreb exhibition is also accompanied by a comprehensive monograph with interpretative critical commentaries on each artist.",News
"Caracinids <p/> They have no common body feature by which they can be definitely identified.They are elongate in shape, and the size of the head is small relative to the body. The size varies widely, from less than a centimetre to over half a metre. The colour diversity is equally varied, with over 1000 species known. <p/> This family is characterised by gentle and peaceful representatives (e.g. various species of tetras - neonids, fireflies, serpa....).On the other hand, this family includes true predators, with an extremely strongly developed jaw and sharp teeth (e.g. most species of piranha).The caracinids are gregarious fish, living either in large schools or small groups, but in any case they are not solitary. The vast majority of caracinids are characterised by their vibrant colours and peaceful cohabitation with other aquarium inhabitants. However, they are also a highly predatory species, characterised by aggressiveness, as they generally do not tolerate competition in their vicinity. They breed freely, which means that they deposit their eggs freely in the water.They usually do not care about their offspring and most often eat most of the eggs themselves.If we want to breed them, we have to make sure that the parents do not get to the eggs.In professional breeding, special nets are used for this purpose, but it is enough to put a little thicker aquarium sand at the bottom of the spawning aquarium, among which the eggs fall after spawning. <p/> Serpa is a fiery red colour, the colouration depends largely on the conditions in which it lives, in darker aquariums its colour is more pronounced.It is a pronounced schooling fish, which grows up to 4 cm. <p/> A beautiful fish that has been known in the aquarium trade since 2007 and overnight became the No.1 fish in the aquarium world.",Information/Explanation
"Elvis Kudič, athlete (09 / 2013) <p/> When I first came to the Althea Centre, I was immediately taken care of. It all started with tap dancing, and then Nena and I talked about what I was training. I said athletics and that I was very scared of competitions, but Nena suggested mental training. After the first session I felt different, I have been doing it for a year now and the progress is very good (from 1 to 10 it's a 10! ). I am relaxed, confident, I have a goal in mind. Of course, there are still a lot of things to improve. I feel great in Althea. <p/> Kristina Novak, tennis player, 13 years old (09 / 2013) <p/> Filip Zupančič, tennis player (08 / 2012) <p/> I've had a lot of mental training, but none has been as reliable as the IMT® mental training at Althea®. During the training you relax (sometimes you almost fall asleep, although you are still fully concentrated) and when you wake up again you are full of energy. Nena and I have been working together for a little less than a year now and the results are obvious. I feel great even in the face of injuries, and I perform very confidently in tournaments. The exercises we do are reliable, they help me a lot. From my side that would be everything, I really recommend you if you have / will have any possible problem to come to Althea® and feel this great atmosphere. Filip <p/> Blaž Kavčič, top tennis player (07 / 2012) <p/> I first came into contact with the Althea® Health and Harmony Centre a little over two years ago when I had to put my best friend (tennis racket) in a corner because of a tear in the back of my leg. I was in great mental distress as no therapy was helping and I didn't know what to do. For a top athlete, there is nothing worse than having to lie down and rest... Since then, I have always turned to them when I am in trouble. <p/> As soon as I entered Althea I knew I had come to the right place. On the first day of therapy I was welcomed by a physiotherapist and her friend Tecar®. After just a few therapies I could feel a big difference. My leg was more relaxed and the pain slowly subsided, and soon I was able to return to the tennis courts again. But there was still one big problem... I couldn't put the same strain on my leg as before the injury and I felt I couldn't help it. I had a brake in my head ... <p/> That's when Nena came to my rescue. With IMT® training, we broke through the block in a few days and my movement on the court became much better and I felt I was the one on the court again, because it was very difficult to send the ball past me. Nena also taught me to listen to myself and my body. Now I can often help myself. <p/> I would like to thank everyone at Althea® from the bottom of my heart, because they have saved me many difficult days that I would have had to spend without tennis. Tecar®, Bionic®, IMT® and kinesiotaping is surely the best combination of therapies for injury recovery and I highly recommend Althea® to anyone who needs help. <p/> Blaž Kavčič <p/> Miran Stanovnik (28.5.2012, after his injury in Dubai, completion of therapy) <p/> After Miran's injury in Dubai, in addition to physiotherapy and kinesiotaping, we also did IMT® intuitive mental training and energy therapies as a support to the basic therapy, in order to speed up rehabilitation and to clean up the effects of the injury on all other levels, not only on the physical body. The following is a description of his experience, which was very powerful, because he gave himself completely to the therapy and his intention was to completely rehabilitate all the consequences (physical, mental, energetic) of this injury, as well as all the previous ones that had happened to him, in the shortest possible time, which is why the reaction was more intense and the result was extremely fast, which was his intention, which he had set for himself. <p/> Dear friends, My meetings with my pleasant and professional friends from the Althea® Centre in Lesce are coming to their final stage. The rehabilitation has more than succeeded. But I have tried something new again (at least for me). Nena kindly asked me if we could also try one energy therapy (reiki) together with IMT® mental training. Of course, why not. Of course I didn't expect any revolution, but I participated fully, like everything I do. She also warned me that I might get a little cold after the treatment because the energy would be cleansing... Well yes, it's no joke I can tell you that. I got so cold on the way home after the treatment that I set the internal temperature in my car to 28 degrees Celsius and it wasn't enough. At home I covered my head with two blankets (not duvets) and that was barely enough. But within an hour my body reacted with a fever (38 degrees). After a few hours I just lift my head and ask Nena for a commentary on the events. Such a strong reaction to everything we did, cleansing on all levels, because I was prepared for it and went into the process ""full on"", says my therapist. Yes, I spent a few more days in bed, but the very next day there was a significant improvement in the condition of the injury, and the very next day I forgot about the crutches for walking around the flat, which means that it helped, and since that day I have only used them for walking up the stairs... A crazy good experience, I tell you. Now I've read it again and I see that my writing looks terribly ""cracked"", but I'm not going to correct it, because everything I said is true. <p/> Miran <p/> Jure Robič, top extreme cyclist (09 / 2010) <p/> Dear Nena, I have been promising you for too long that I would write about how I experience our ""sessions"". Well, now I have made time for you, just as you have always made time for me whenever I need you, day or night. When I told you in the first session that I trusted you and believed in you and that you could do whatever you wanted, just to get better and get back to racing as soon as possible, I had no idea that change could be so fast and so effective. When you got me up and racing in four days after a serious injury, with the help of Bionic®, Tecar® and especially your IMT® mental technique, I started to understand why things were happening to me in the lake in the first place. A new world is really opening up for me, as you predicted. I know it's all in my head, it's just that now, with your help, I know how to put what's bothering me out of my mind. I can't wait for us to continue. See you)) <p/> Miran Stanovnik, top motorcyclist (07 / 2010) <p/> My first meeting with Nena and Althea® was the result of a conversation and a personal recommendation from Jureto (Robič), who couldn't praise the ""treatments"" enough. Despite the relatively long distance from my home, I regularly visited Althea® in Lesce when I had injuries, which are an integral part of almost every athlete's life. I have received individual massage treatment, Bionic® therapy, Tecar® therapy, as well as IMT® intuitive mental training, a method I am really enthusiastic about. The result was shockingly good for me. I don't bother with the details of how each segment works, because for me it's important that it works. And that is for sure. <p/> I did not believe in it at first, but then I was convinced by the real effects, and I was completely taken in. At the beginning, I thought, what is this going to do for me, how can this possibly work, this is just something, blah blah blah, ... but, as I said, I was fascinated by the effect. Every human being has certain blockages, unprocessed patterns, every human being has a problem somewhere - maybe they are aware of it, maybe they are not. Nena, I was taken by her very calmness, I felt that myself. She is a woman I trusted immediately. After giving birth, I had a big problem with iron. There was no way, even with medical help, that it would improve. Quite by chance, when I met Nena, I complained about the matter and she suggested that we look at where I might have a blockage, the psychological reasons that were causing it. Well, we did find the cause: I had a desperate guilty conscience because I wasn't with my daughter non-stop and all that was eating my iron, and when we looked at all these patterns of guilt, cleared them up, came to terms with it, when I looked the matter in the eye, it got abnormally better and better. During the Olympic Games in Vancouver, Nena and I spent a lot of time in contact via Skype. This IMT® mental training can also be done remotely, and she helped me to step over difficult mental barriers. I was able to. Sometimes you may think that the problem is somewhere on the surface, but when you look deep inside you realise that it's the patterns you have in you from childhood that are now ""jumping out"". I found myself in this IMT® training, in this therapy. It helps me a lot. It's not just a therapy for sport, it's a therapy that enriches me for life. I realise that I still have a lot of work to do on myself and this is a method where you can see the effect after just one therapy, you can see the progress, the change immediately. I recommend it to everyone who wants to be happy with themselves. For me, this therapy has opened my eyes, and I look at certain things with different glasses. I calm down when I have therapy with Nena, she calms me down, after all it is my time, which I spend on myself and enrich myself. <p/> Vasja Rupnik, biathlon team Slovenia (06 / 2010) <p/> I myself have never believed in intangible, unexplainable things, but after I started working with the Altheo® Centre, with Nena, I started to realise that it is only the ego that is the problem to a better and more confident performance in competitions, and in life! With the help of therapies, which are not even therapies, but a conversation, or with Nena's help, digging into your subconscious, you discover that fears and blockages are part of you, you just have to dare to discover them, to do that you need the desire for a better and easier life, of course, without Nena's help and guidance it's not possible, so thank you for the feedback and I recommend it for the future! <p/> Maja Kokol, children's presenter, animator and singer (05 / 2010) <p/> I have been dedicated to children in my work in various ways for 23 years. Working and socialising with them has confirmed to me over and over again how fairy-tale and magical this world is. That is why I believe in miracles, fairy tales and angels - Nena is certainly one of them. The severe trials, the extreme sadness and the fear of ""tomorrow"" are the circumstances that have brought her my way. I am a great optimist but I can say that without her help I would not have made it through that period - especially not in that way. Nena is not only a friend but also a great therapist who gives me energy, warmth, words... - whatever she feels I need at that moment. Because she is so visibly successful in all this, her ideas, advice or just telling me about something good always opens my heart and makes me curious - and so it was with the IMT® technique. She changed my life, completely - turned it upside down like a whirlpool, leaving behind the devastation of old patterns, thoughts, connections and sowing new seeds with a firm and determined will. That is why, my dear Nena, you are my angel - in all forms, in all areas. With your help, I have become who I am and for that I will always be grateful! <p/> Nika, tennis player (02 / 2011) <p/> IMT® therapy helps me with all the things I do, not just tennis. I have noticed much less fussing (if any) about others or about external things that I can't control. I am much more in touch with myself and my needs. I am somehow living more in a kind of ""peace"". At the beginning I had doubts in myself in terms of opening up. I am a person who finds it very difficult to trust someone completely and therefore to believe them. I have to say that I trusted you from the very beginning of our IMT® therapy, which is not typical for me. The therapies also help me in general in my life and are not only related to sports. In fact, for many years I lived in a bubble that I didn't want to get out of. Everybody could say or do anything to me, but I always acted completely calm on the outside. With your help, I am now actually speaking my mind, without fearing the outcome. I don't even think about what if it had been, or why it happened, but I live in the moment and do what needs to be done. My own execution, accuracy and power of my strokes has also improved with the IMT® therapies we do. <p/>Spella (12 / 2011) <p/>The barrel of repressed problems and fears has finally been filled. There was no more room and the eruption had to happen. For me as a psychological problem. I landed on antidepressants. But since I am still too young to walk with crutches (that's what doctors call treating mental problems with pills) I decided to take matters into my own hands. I knew that Nena had a health centre, but I had no idea how it could help me. But since the devil is still a fly in the ointment, I figured it couldn't get any worse and called her. We made an appointment for therapy. And lo and behold, after the very first IMT® session, I felt relief. A second one followed, and a third, ... Today I feel really great and I am eternally grateful to Neni. And yet more proof that the therapies really do help. One of my many fears was walking in the woods. I didn't go there alone if I could, even though I enjoy the woods. Every noise made me shiver, I was afraid of meeting a person, an animal... This fear of mine was rooted deep in my subconscious and stemmed from events in my past. After one of the therapies I went to the forest to test the effect. Alone. Amazing. The fear of forest visitors and the silence with the occasional rustling of leaves, wind, ... was gone. Walking means relaxation, recharging my batteries, talking to myself. <p/> Everything in life happens for a reason. Nena, you were one of the better and more beautiful ones. Thank you. I love coming back to therapy because it really helps me to understand what is going on around me. Therapies make my perception of the world more positive.",Review
"17 replies to "" Even in the municipality of Ravenna "" in a domestic way "" "" <p/> What is it with this journalist that she writes things that are two years old, and populist ones at that. The SDS party got 10 councillors and a mayor. The SD party got two councillors, Zares got 3 councillors, the NSI got one, etc... Around the same time, the seats on the committees were also divided up, or the SDS got even fewer than it could have. Check the data available. The most important is the Supervisory Committee, where the opposition has the chair and the majority of members. In this way, things are 'balanced'. Of course, the glass can always be half full or half empty, depending on which eyes are looking at it. It is normal, however, that the opposition always wants to minimise the successes and inflate the weaknesses to the extreme. All credit to the mayor and his team for what they have achieved in the town, and it may not be all good, but it is far from all bad. <p/>It is only the political staffing that bothers me, but I would like to point out that many of these SDS directors have improved things and put things on the right footing, and nobody mentions that. I am not taking sides, but I think that, yes, it is not all black. Many times when I go to the flatlands, where I was born, I find that many people are negative, and they all tell the same stories, and it is quite clear to me that somebody has set them up against the mayor. But perhaps we already know of a candidate for mayor in the forthcoming local elections? ? ? It also bothers me that the freedoms are being used for the benefit of one political party, namely the SD. Its members are always at these protests, and in this case the protests, which I support, are taking on political overtones. People should say what they think, not be persuaded to do so by one political option. <p/> After all, it is the SD, or the young forum, that is behind everything, and they have their noses up in everything good that is done in Ravenna. And what the fuck is that to the demonstrator in front of the municipality from Ravne! Let the others go and demonstrate in front of their municipalities, because in the end Prevale has two vice-mayors. No, it is only Ravne that is under attack. The Young Forum of the Mežiška dolina Valley is, as far as we can understand, the young forum of the whole valley, not just Ravne, and they should do something elsewhere, not just go around Ravne on the orders of their silver uncles from behind the scenes. <p/> Who reads this red Dnevnik ... and just ask yourselves and investigate who paid some money to this Mojca to write such an article (a paid article). Kudos to Mayor Rozen, he has done a lot for the people ... but only those who want to line their pockets are slandering ... a little morgen, you will be waiting ... <p/> I have to speak up. I am an ordinary citizen just observing what is happening in Ravne. I am also interested to see the recordings of the municipal council meetings. I must say that I am VERY SATISFIED with the leadership of our municipality. However, it is obvious that Councillors Halilovič and Vrhovnik are doing everything they can to undermine the work of the mayor and his team. What is the purpose of such action is clear to all. Because they feel that there is not enough publicity at the meetings themselves, they have to take to the streets. That is why I was not surprised to see, in the video footage of the assembly in front of the municipal building, mainly supporters of the pole that has too few members on the municipal council. Therefore, people - do not be fooled into thinking that this assembly was about improving the situation. It was about letting the street allow those who failed in the elections to rise - whether that is good or bad for the citizens. <p/>I see you are all more right-wing up here, I tell you we have a trunk full of your politics and don't dream that only reds are protesting in the street. I for one am for honest politics be it left or right, I have no bad words for Rozen but I don't think he has kept the right deputy mayor. <p/> Aljaž Vrhovnik will be loud? A teenager who rushes to the trough more than a calf to a cow, pretending to be clever about things that logically he has no clue about, because he is simply being a child. I have nothing against young people, but what is too much is too much, and he is running for mayor - and half the stupid journalists quote him. I don't know who is the bigger half-ass.

"T=0°C and snowing, small to medium snowflakes are falling quite densely, so the grass is white and the roads are starting to stick. I'm predicting max and very optimistic 5 cm of snow by this morning (the 30 we talked about on Thursday is like some kind of fatamorgana in the desert). I'm happy to see that at least I'm seeing snow and this isn't a complete fiasco and a hoax by the models, because then I'd be seriously questioning what's the point of all this looking at charts when it's all blowing up like a soap bubble practically in front of my nose. The ARSO should also be commended for not falling under the euphoria like us young snow-lovers and then having noses 5x longer than the height of the snow cover, the last 5-10 cm of which I immediately subscribe to! <p/> Logged in <p/> Rosi T=1,4°C here we are practically done with the precipitation,it's all going too far south.At the end of the precipitation it just snowed for a few minutes,but to no effect. <p/> From Velenje, the illuminated transmitter at Urška is visible, and the fog has already risen to over 1200 mnm even on the Mozir mountains <p/> All I saw today that was similar to snow were a few more dense raindrops between Celje and Arja vasja at around 20:00, but otherwise just rain! <p/> Once again we stayed with long noses this year... <p/> Well, yes... it stopped raining (I put my car out in the rain and at least it washed off), I didn't see a single snowflake, I don't even know what the snowy surroundings of my home look like anymore,... but it could have been worse. It could have rained up to 1800m.a.s.l............................................... <p/> Maybe the precipitation mentioned above really will come to us... <p/> .. like us young snow lovers and then have noses 5x longer than the snow cover... <p/> That is to say, noses are no longer than before because 5 x 0cm = 0 <p/> Otherwise, here at +2.0°C and 98% RH, it is still raining lightly. No snowflakes in sight yet. They will come soon... but unfortunately too late. <p/> No sign of snow here either, it has stopped raining, I hope that's not all because the temperature is still dropping and it's 3.1. It's true that 14mm of rain fell, but somehow I was expecting more intense precipitation when I saw the maps! <p/> I'm really glad that at least the interior got snow, because otherwise I would have been lynched by my colleagues when I predicted snow in the forecast below. Oh, and Vrhnika will be at least a little bit white by tomorrow, and Logatec is already a little bit white, judging by the DARS pictures. <p/> Good night. <p/> Anyway, it's not a complete hoax, but it was close to it. <p/> Forecast Saturday, 02 February 2008 Latest weather models indicate a marginal snow situation in the lowlands of continental Slovenia. Wet snow may fall in the lowlands and will mainly melt. The greatest chance of snow cover in the lowlands is in the areas of Kočevje, Cerknica, Logatec, Postojna, Novo mesto and Snežnik and surroundings. There, between 5 and 10 cm of snow may fall under favourable conditions. In most parts of the country, snow is certain to fall at 500 metres above sea level or higher, especially during the night on Sunday, by which time it will have weakened and gradually stopped in the north and east of the country. <p/> What's up, they've got the models right Here it starts to mix with snow from 450m upwards, around Senožeč and Razdrteg it snows, but it doesn't stick...only about 50m higher up it starts. The intensity is terrible. Heavy precipitation over the Adriatic, Kvarner and Friuli. Temp here is +2.9, so that with suitable precipitation it would turn around later... so only storm with gusts around 50km/h, Podnanos even up to 80km/h Today 25.6mm fell. <p/> Žiri, temperature 0.9°C, snowing. A little higher it is white, but there is no ""force"". Well, yes, at least there will be something for an artistic impression, but if not sooner, next time.",Forum

"An applicant for a review of a public tender does not, under the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures, per se acquire the status of a party to an administrative dispute in which the administrative decision awarding the concession is challenged, which concludes a tendering procedure in which he did not participate. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The appeal is dismissed and the decision of the Administrative Court of the Republic of Slovenia in Ljubljana, No U 2088/2001-9 of 30 January 2002 is confirmed. <p/> Reasoning <p/> By the contested order, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action against the defendant's decision of 22.11.2001 under point 1 of the operative part of the order and dismissed the application for interim measures of 23.11.2001 under point 2 of the operative part of the order.By that decision granting a concession for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services, it was decided to grant the concession to M. d.d. for a period of 15 years, with the possibility of renewal, V., L. It was also decided that the concession shall include the right to use the frequency bands, to install the relevant public telecommunications network, to interconnect the network and that the concessionaire shall be obliged to ensure the operation of its network in accordance with the Regulation on the granting of concessions, with other regulations and with the concession contract, to pay a one-off non-refundable concession fee of 22 billion Slovenian tolls and to pay an annual fee for the use of the allocated part of the radio spectrum. The defendant published a public tender for the award of up to three concessions for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia in the frequency bands 1900 MHz-1980 MHz, 2010 MHz-2025 MHz and 2110 MHz-2170 MHz in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 19/01 of 16.3.2001. The first call for tenders was unsuccessful because only one tender was received, and a new call for tenders for the award of the concession was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 46/01 of 8.6.2001. At the time of the opening of the tenders, the expert committee noted that five potential tenderers had submitted tender documents on the basis of the call for tenders, and that two tenders had been received within the time limit for submission of the tenders within the time limit for submission of tenders. One bid did not contain all the elements required in the tender documents and was therefore not considered. On 3.9.2001, the applicant submitted a request for review of the concession award procedure to the National Audit Office. By decision of 8.11.2001, the latter rejected the request for review. The concession award procedure, which had been suspended as a result of the submitted review, was continued. The expert committee, which drew up its report of 19.11.2001, found that the tender submitted by M.d.d. met the conditions of the tender documents. In the grounds of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance stated in paragraph 1 of the operative part of the judgment that it had taken its decision to reject the application on the basis of the preliminary examination of the application under Article 34(1)(4) of the Administrative Disputes Act (CLA). A claimant in an administrative dispute can only be a person who has the status of an active party in the administrative proceedings, a person who has the status of a passive party and a person who has participated in the administrative proceedings as an intervener in order to protect his rights or legal interests. In the procedure for the award of the concession, in addition to the successful concessionaire, parties to the procedure may be those tenderers whose bids were not accepted. The tenders for the concession were submitted by M.d.d. and D.d.o.o. within the tendering period, but the applicant did not participate in the tender. In an administrative dispute challenging a decision taken in an administrative procedure in which the applicant was neither a party nor an intervener, the applicant does not have standing, since the contested decision clearly did not infringe its rights or direct interests based on the law. The applicant has not established the right or the legal interest to assert the claim alleged in the application and its active standing, which is a procedural prerequisite for bringing an administrative action, is not established. The applicant's request for a review of the procedure for the award of the concession for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services was rejected by decision of the State Audit Commission of 8.11.2001. Article 23(2) of the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 78/99 and No 90/99) provides that there is no ordinary or extraordinary remedy against the decisions of the State Audit Board, but that an action may be brought before a competent court to seek damages from the contracting authority. Objections relating to the award procedure which have already been decided by the National Audit Office do not constitute legally relevant objections in the review procedure of the concession award decision. In the explanatory memorandum to 2. point 2 of the operative part of the judgment, the Court of First Instance stated that the applicant had not established that the decision challenged in the action infringed its rights or its direct interests based on the law, which is a procedural prerequisite for a decision on an application for an interim injunction under Article 69 of the Civil Procedure Code. This follows from the reasons set out in recital 1 of the operative part of the judgment, since the applicant has failed to establish its standing to bring the action. The Court of First Instance therefore dismissed the application for interim measures pursuant to Article 69(2) of the Civil Code. <p/> The applicant appeals on all three grounds set out in Article 72 of the Civil Procedure Code. The appellant claims that the Court of Appeal should set aside both points of the contested order and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a fresh decision. The applicant claims that it has standing to bring the action and the application for interim measures in the present proceedings. The Court of First Instance bases its position solely on the fact that the applicant did not submit a tender in response to the invitation to tender and thus did not participate directly as an active party or as a passive party or intervener. Such reasoning effectively limits the potential claimants in an administrative dispute exclusively to direct and formal parties to the procedure prior to the adoption of the administrative act, for which there is no legal basis in Article 18 of the CPL. The circle of potential claimants in an administrative dispute is much wider under that provision. Anyone who believes that an administrative act infringes a right or a direct benefit of his or her based on the law may be a claimant. The theory also recognises the active standing of a party who has not even formally participated in the administrative procedure, provided that he can, of course, establish or prove his legal interest. In a tendering procedure, the legal status of intervener within the meaning of Article 43 of the General Administrative Procedure Act cannot exist. It was only possible to participate in the tendering procedure as a tenderer or as an applicant for review under the Act on Review of Public Procurement Procedures. In the review procedure, the applicant was granted the status of a party and active standing. It is reasonable to assume that, taking into account the specificities of the tender procedure, the applicant was indeed a party to the tender procedure as an applicant for review and was granted such status by the defendant and the National Audit Office. It therefore considers that it had already demonstrated its legal interest in participating in the tendering procedure in the procedure preceding the defendant's decision by submitting a request for review, since it did not submit a tender on the ground that the tendering procedure was unlawful. It can therefore legitimately claim that the contested decision of the defendant, as an administrative act adopted in the context of a tendering procedure, infringes its rights and directly benefits. In fact, as a result of the illegality of the invitation to tender, the applicant lost the possibility of obtaining the concession which was the subject of the invitation to tender and which was finally awarded to M. by the contested administrative decision, as an act adopted in a procedure which the applicant claims to have been unlawful. It is untenable to hold that it has active standing to bring an application for review in the same proceedings in which, following the conclusion of those proceedings and the adoption of the administrative act, it does not have active standing to bring the action. Apart from the finding that the applicant did not submit its bid in the tendering procedure and the erroneous assertion that it did not assert or protect its rights in the concession award procedure, that is to say, in the tendering procedure, the Court of First Instance does not give any other substantive reasoning in the contested order. It did not serve the application and the application for interim measures on the defendant for a response. Nor did it hold the main hearing which had been requested in order to further substantiate the allegations by examining witnesses. It did not even state reasons for its decision, since it did not state the reasons on the decisive facts, which constitutes an absolute fundamental infringement of the procedural provisions within the meaning of Article 72(3) of the Civil Procedure Code. By failing to hold a main hearing, the Court of First Instance substantially infringed the procedural provisions within the meaning of Article 72(4) of the Civil Procedure Code. In addition, it erred and failed to fully establish the factual situation as regards the applicant's legal status and activities in the tendering procedure itself and its rights and direct benefits, and, as a consequence, it erred in substantive law in holding that the applicant did not have active legal standing to bring the action in the present proceedings. The applicant also has standing to bring an application for interim measures and, in accordance with the provisions of the CPL, fully maintains its application for interim measures in the present case. <p/> In its response to the appeal, the defendant submits that the applicant cannot be a party to these proceedings as it lacks standing. The applicant did not submit a bid for the concession either in the first or in the re-tender. The fact that the applicant has already provided mobile telecommunications services does not automatically confer a legal interest in bringing the present action. Since it did not participate in the concession award procedure by submitting any tender, the concession award decision did not decide on its rights. The administrative measure therefore does not affect her rights or a legitimate interest. The possibility of exercising the right to obtain the concession ended with the expiry of the time-limit for submitting a complete tender for the invitation to tender. The fact that the applicant has been granted a legal interest in the review procedure before the National Audit Office does not automatically confer a legal interest in the administrative proceedings. In the proceedings before the National Audit Commission, the status of a party is determined by Article 9 of the Law on the review of public procurement procedures, whereas in the proceedings before the Administrative Court, it is determined by Article 18 of the CPL. Each law defines the active legal capacity of the parties in a different way. The Law on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures provides for a wider range of beneficiaries who may initiate a review procedure on the ground that an independent body is reviewing the legality of the public tender itself. Given that the party has been granted the status of party to the proceedings there, the competent authority has already assessed the legality of the call for tenders and rejected the request for review. The defendant submits, first of all, that the whole tendering procedure is unlawful and that it was therefore not possible for it to participate in the procedure. In the proceedings before the Administrative Court, however, the circle of persons with standing is narrower. It is for the competent court to determine whether the appellant's request to intervene is justified. Such a procedure prevents the chicanery of intervention by those who cannot show any prejudice and who would only make the proceedings more difficult for an active or passive party. The appellant therefore requests the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal as unfounded. <p/> The appeal is not well founded. <p/> In the Court of Appeal's view, the Court of First Instance was correct to dismiss the applicant's action on the basis of paragraph 34(1)(4) of Article 34(1) of the EC Treaty. <p/> of Article 34 of the CPL. The applicant's plea that it has active standing to bring an action in an administrative dispute is unfounded, since it relies on its indirect participation in the tendering procedure by virtue of the fact that it was the applicant in an application for review of a procurement procedure to which it was granted the status of a party. According to Article 18(1) of the CPL, a claimant may be an individual, a legal person, an organisation, a locality, a group of persons and others who consider that a right or a direct benefit of theirs based on a law has been infringed by an administrative act. However, according to the provision of Article 9 of the Act on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures (Official Gazette of the RS, No 78/99), a request for review may be lodged by any person who has or had an interest in the award of a contract and who has suffered or may suffer damage as a result of the conduct of the contracting authority, which is alleged in the request for review as a misconduct of the contracting authority in the procedure for awarding the public contract. The Law on the Review of Public Procurement Procedures is a specific regulation governing the legal protection of tenderers in public procurement procedures, which is implemented by reviewing the public procurement procedures defined in the Public Procurement Law, the bodies competent for the protection of the rights of tenderers and the procedure governing the work of the bodies under this Law. However, there is no ordinary or extraordinary legal remedy against a decision of the State Audit Board, only an action before a competent court of law to seek damages from the contracting authority. Given the purpose and object of this law, the active standing in a review procedure is substantively different from that in an administrative dispute. Any person who has or had an interest in the award of a contract and any person who has suffered or may suffer damage as a result of the conduct of the contracting authority may bring an action for review. For this reason, a party to a review of public procurement procedures does not per se acquire the status of a party to administrative litigation proceedings when the decision to award a concession is challenged. The decision to award a concession puts an end to the tendering procedure, and an action against such a decision may only be brought by persons fulfilling the conditions laid down in Article 18(1) of the CPL. In the present case, the request for review of the concession award procedure was examined by the National Audit Commission and the specific request of the defendant was rejected. The subject-matter of the administrative dispute cannot therefore be a repetition of the identical claim, which is in fact the applicant's claim. In an administrative procedure, the applicant could only assert a right or a direct benefit based on a right which would be infringed by the decision to grant the concession. The grant of the concession is not a right of the defendant. The defendant's only right in a tendering procedure for the award of a concession is to submit its tender to the contracting authority within the time-limit, on the same terms as the other participants. Neither the Telecommunications Act nor the Regulation on the granting of concessions for the use of the radio spectrum for the provision of UMTS/IMT-2000 services gives rise to a direct benefit to the applicant based on the Act. It is apparent from the appellant's submissions that the defendant is only claiming an interest in fact in obtaining the concession, and is not demonstrating a legal interest by challenging the concession decision. In the present case, since there is neither a right nor a direct interest of the defendant based on the law which is infringed by the contested administrative measure, the Court of Appeal considers that the Court of First Instance was correct in its decision that the applicant had not established its active standing in the present administrative proceedings. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the action at the preliminary examination stage on the basis of Article 34(1)(4) of the CPL. At that stage of the proceedings, the Court of First Instance ruled exclusively on the applicant's standing, and therefore did not infringe the provision on the main hearing procedure (Article 72(4) of the Civil Procedure Code), since it did not rule on the substance or examine the substance of the contested measure. Nor did it serve copies of the application for interim measures and the application for interim measures with annexes on the defendant at that stage of the proceedings. It does so only after it has not dismissed the action under Article 34 of the Civil Procedure Code or annulled the contested measure under Article 35(1) of the Civil Procedure Code or declared it void under Article 35(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. The Court of First Instance also did not infringe the provision on the procedure in an administrative dispute (Article 72(3) of the CPL), since it based and explained its decision on the distinction between tendering, review and public procurement procedures and an administrative dispute (pages 3 and 4 of the judgment). <p/> The pleas in law alleging erroneous and incomplete findings of fact and incorrect application of the substantive law, however, relate only to the applicant's active standing. <The appellant's plea in law alleging that the application for interim measures was dismissed is also unfounded. The applicant does not have standing to bring an application for interim measures if it does not have standing to bring an action in administrative proceedings and, moreover, does not state on what grounds that that part of the order is unlawful. <p/> The Court of Appeal held that the grounds on which the applicant challenges the order of the Court of First Instance are not established. Nor are the grounds on which the Court of First Instance is required to act of its own motion. It therefore dismissed the appeal as unfounded on the basis of Article 73 in conjunction with Article 68 of the CLA and upheld the order of the Court of First Instance.",Legal/Regulation

"Memories <p/> Memories <p/> After the war we lived on food, textile and other necessities. But just because you had a card didn't mean that you could get the goods you needed. Our mothers were queuing outside the shops long before they opened. Hardly expected and essential goods for families were not always in perfect condition. The flour was often (as we used to say) ""alive"". <p/> This meant that moths had invaded it. We did not throw away such flour either. My mother would fry the flour in a large pan on a hot fire to kill the animals, then sieve it on a thick sieve and that was how we used it later. <p/> I also remember what underwear was like in those years. There was no elastic in the underpants, just a plain ribbon, and we had to tie our underpants with it. When the underwear got proud and tore, it would be patched up. It was also often the case that double underpants became single underpants. Men's shirts were also mended. The bottom part was cut off and the collar and cuffs were redone. <p/> Socks that could no longer be mended were also cut above the ankle and a part of the other socks was added. So, once again, a new pair was made from the double worn-out socks. <p/> The dresses were not ready-made, but were made for us by seamstresses who may or may not have been trained in this profession. The dresses were sewn for the children in such a way that the length could be extended by at least 10 cm. We children grew quickly and a dress sewn in this way could grow with us for some time. When we outgrew the length of the dress, a new piece of fabric was inserted into the sleeves, usually in a different material and pattern to the original dress. <p/> Coats were made in the same way. When we outgrew them, despite the lengthening, they would fray and the cloth would turn the other way and be sewn into a new coat for the next child... <p/> Without spots and without cards, we could buy tennis shoes on Partizanska Street near Borovo. These were summer shoes that were made of rubber underneath and canvas on top. They were usually grey in colour. We children brightened them up by painting them with white chalk. I don't know how we got the paint to stay on, we must have got the chalk wet. <p/> In the summer we also wore special summer slippers, which were made of cornhusks. We could get them for free (no tickets). The slippers were so sharp that we often had bloody toes. <p/> In the summer we also wore ""spaghetti shoes"", which were made by a shoemaker. They were made of felt (strong felt), grey in colour. The felt was connected to the sole by a shoelace. The children also wore such shoes for special occasions - for example, for confirmation. <p/> The shoemakers put metal rings on the toes and heels so that we could wear the shoes.",Information/Explanation

"Smoking poses one of the biggest risks to our bodies <p/> 3 June 2019 <p/> Snoring is not just a sound, an acoustic effect that disturbs us or the person sleeping next to us, it is an indicator and symptom of serious health problems. <p/> ""Smoking damages the skin and mucous membranes. Smokers age their skin more quickly, their skin sags more quickly, and they lose collagen elasticity. This also causes more people to snore and suffer from other serious health problems,"" said Aleksandra Križaj Dumić, Director of the Križaj Dental and Aesthetic Clinic, which has a tradition of more than 20 years, at a press meeting ahead of World No Smoking Day. <p/> Snoring is not just a sound, an acoustic effect that disturbs us or the person sleeping next to us, it is an indicator and symptom of serious health problems - high blood pressure, insufficient oxygen intake, poor blood circulation and brain activity. Airway obstructions can be so severe that people can stop breathing several times a night for a few minutes at a time. For this reason, snoring should be treated seriously and resolved immediately. ""Snoring can also be eliminated with laser therapy. The advantages of this treatment are numerous, but what patients like most is that they have no problems after the laser treatment, they can eat, drink and speak normally, and they can return to work immediately without any problems, as the treatment does not require post-operative recovery,"" outlined Aleksandra Križaj Dumić. Laser surgery is an effective and quick solution if the cause of snoring is a sagging or loose mucous membrane in the soft palate. The NightLase laser therapy includes three visits at the beginning and one annual refresher treatment for non-smokers and two for smokers. Patients breathe easier and snore less at night after the treatment. Laser treatment helps about 80 per cent of carefully selected patients and about 70 per cent of all patients examined. In most patients, snoring time is almost halved. Sleep quality improves as patients take less time to fall asleep and no longer wake up tired. <p/> Before and after laser snoring therapy <p/> A similar procedure is also performed to treat incontinence in gynaecological patients, to increase the tension of the vaginal muscles, to increase the tension of sagging skin on the face and neck, and of the skin in the area of the under-eye area. <p/> Demonstration of laser goat rejuvenation <p/> Smoking therefore also affects the skin.

"From now on, partnership farming also in Styria <p/> First distribution of organic produce baskets between farmers and consumers on Thursday, 12 May 2011 <p/> From tomorrow, consumers in Maribor will also be able to access organically produced food through the partnership farming system in the form of vegetable, fruit and cereal baskets. The first distribution of vegetable and cereal baskets will start on Thursday, 12 May 2011, at 17:00 in the courtyard of the Biotikva farm in Limbuš near Maribor (Lackova cesta 267, 2341 Limbuš). At the end of May, the participating farmers will further expand their offer of vegetable baskets and will also offer fruit baskets to consumers. <p/> The ECHo association, which initiated and organises this project in Styria and Prekmurje, is pleased with the current response. 7 organic farms have joined the partnership and will provide consumers with weekly vegetable, fruit and cereal baskets, as well as other products from organic production and processing: spreads, juices, jams, bread, eggs, meat and dairy products. 34 consumers have chosen to buy organic food in the context of partner farming. This is the first attempt of this kind of sales between organic farmers and consumers without intermediaries in this part of Slovenia. With this project, the association wants to promote the development of organic farming among farmers and to support organic farmers. <p/> What is partnership farming? <p/> Partnership farming is a new way of linking farmers and consumers in Slovenia. Different models (CSA - Community Supported Agriculture) have proliferated around the world, but they have a common denominator: they promote local, sustainable and ethical consumerism, with a special emphasis on solidarity among small farmers who farm without synthetic fertilisers and sprays. Typically, it is one farmer or a group of farmers who sell their produce to 20 to 30 customers. Before the sowing season, the farmer talks to the consumers about their wishes, clear rules are agreed, then the farmer sows the area and supplies the crops according to organic production technology and regulations. The produce grown on the agreed area is distributed weekly to the consumers. <p/> Once consumers have opted in, they meet the farmer and other consumers each week at an agreed date, time and location to collect their basket. They can also exchange produce and products with each other. In this way, the farmer supplies his consumers every week throughout the year with organic food that is truly fresh and has a very short transport route from the field to the plate. This way, the consumer knows exactly who grows their food, where and how. Consumers receive high quality organic food and the farmer is able to live with dignity as a result of this cooperation.",News

Otherwise, I liked I Was a Princess. It is an autobiography. I am guilh these days reading a book by Khaled Hosseini, A Thousand Splendid Suns - and I really recommend that book to you.

"Bihač Open 2012 <p/> by Stjepko Marenić <p/> 22.05.2012 <p/> The traditional Bihač Open this year did not shine in the light that we have been used to for the last few years. I don't know the exact reason for that, it just seemed to me that everything was organised and carried out with less passion and enthusiasm. <p/> The weigh-in started at around 15:00. When the competitors arrived, it was immediately noticeable that the women's part of the competition in particular was going to be very modest in participation this year. Only three female competitors in the body-fitness category and two in the bikini category showed up. This is almost disappointing for a competition of this reputation. Apart from the competitors from Bosnia and Herzegovina, who were not very competitive this year, most of the competitors came from Croatia. I missed the representatives from Slovenia and Hungary, whose participation greatly increased the quality and competitiveness of the competition. <p/> The number of visitors to the competition was also disappointing. The visiting hall has been considerably fuller in recent years, and the fans have been in a better mood. <p/> The competition started at 18:30.

I hope that it will become more established in the coming years. <p/> The competition itself has also been cast in a bad light by some questionable and controversial refereeing decisions. I hope that this will not happen again in the future, as such behaviour by judges may lead to an even greater decline in the number of competitors and thus in the quality of the competition. <p/> Personally, I came back from the competition with good impressions.

Wouldn't it be nice to capture some of those sweet memories forever? <p/> Baby Memory Book <p/> When there is a baby or a young child in the house, young parents certainly have no time to spare. That's why many young parents don't even think of writing down the small and big events of their baby's earliest years, because they are so tired every day that they can hardly wait for a good night's rest. And yet... How quickly childhood passes and how we love to go back to it! Little bigger children want to know everything about their early childhood - what toys they played with, what shoes they wore, what their first bedding was like...

It is only when their parents or grandparents put it into words for them with their own memories that they seem to have linked their feelings and memories into events that make sense and can be explained. The satisfaction they feel in doing so is certainly worth the effort of writing and editing their first memory book. Why not give it to them? Such memories bind adults and children together with a warm bond of love, knowing how much we have always loved them and also - what they have done for us over the years. Isn't that worth writing a line here and there in the first memory book or sticking a photograph in it? <p/> Support for parents What should we write in the first memory book? No, the problem is not that nothing important happened in the baby's life. Too much is happening, because in the first year a baby grows from an almost helpless newborn into a toddler who is already taking his first steps. And in the next year he starts to talk more and more, and better and better, and by the age of three he can do almost ""everything"" - talk, run, fall asleep on his own, catch and throw a ball, draw... The child just needs to deepen and sharpen his knowledge. There is indeed much to write about in the first three years of a child's earliest childhood. <p/> The first memory book is therefore designed so that in each month from birth to the child's third year, the developmental path of the average child is described - his physical development, his motor development, the development of his ability to communicate, etc. And then there is enough space to write down, for each month, information about your own child, an exceptional, beloved and inimitable individual. It is not a question of comparing the average child, or what a child 'should' already know, with our own child, because every child is an inimitable being who is loved for who he or she is, not for what he or she has already achieved. Each child develops at his or her own pace and has every right to do so. The description of developmental characteristics covers only what is common to all children. What young parents want to know is what they can expect in the coming months. <p/> The average developmental characteristics of each month of infant and child age will give parents enough support to also assess what is worth writing about their child. In addition, there is enough space in the first memory book to stick baby's photos, first drawings, descriptions of first funny events, a list of birthday party invitees and so on. <p/> What was it like when I was little? They hardly speak, children want to know what it was like when they were little. They are not at all bothered by the thought that they are, in fact, still small. And they are right - why not look forward to every new step in their development? Just watch a child proudly comparing their 'big' hand with the tiny handprint and sole you have glued in their first memory book! A photo of his first cot will spark a conversation about how he used to sleep and how big he is now. And the photo of him lying next to his first teddy bear will remind you how tiny his body used to be... Children will also love looking at their memory book because each page features cute and playful characters from his childhood - teddy bears, ladybirds, butterflies, elves, Santa Claus, pets... <p/> Jealousy of the baby Such memories, written in the book and in the photographs, can also help a child facing the arrival of a baby brother or sister, a baby who is not difficult to be jealous of because he or she needs so much love and care from their parents. In the conversation around his first memoir, we can show him that, even though he is now a ""bigger"" child, he needed and received all that love and attention too. Perhaps it will be easier for the child to understand that a sibling will one day be as big and independent as he or she is now, that he or she will become a playmate and companion. <p/> If we also write and furnish the baby's first memory book for a sibling, the older child will be able to keep up-to-date with how his or her sibling is developing. Parents will also benefit from such a comparison, because it is nice to know that a child's development always ends the same way, even if at times the moments seem to drag on forever, and at other times time seems to pass at an unbearable speed. <p/> First time at sea, first Christmas and New Year... Children find it difficult to understand the dimension of time - what was six months ago and what will be two years from now. They live primarily in the present moment, which is why it is so difficult for them to wait, even if ""just a little"". At three years old, last summer, when we were at the seaside, seems infinitely far away. Don't be surprised if he doesn't remember anything more than if he had never been to the seaside at all. Because for him, last summer really is very far away. It happened in the previous third of the child's life. If you are thirty years old, that would mean to you that it happened ten years ago... Joking aside. It's much easier for children (and adults too) to reminisce when they see photographs. That's why the first memory book has a special space dedicated to records and photos of your child's first Christmas and New Year, first trip to the seaside and first birthday. Looking at the photos together often brings back memories that you have not kept, but that grandma or grandpa, or sometimes the child, may surprise you and tell you something else that can take you back to happy times. <p/> A gift for a child or grandparent? You can also write and furnish your first memory book almost in secret. Perhaps one day you could give it to your child as a very special gift, telling him or her how much you have always loved him or her and how much you have cared for his or her happiness. You could give it to your child when they come of age, when they get married or when their first child is born. <p/> Or your first memory book can be a nice gift for your grandparents. It will be nice if you write it and give it to them already completed. Or you can give it blank, unfilled. Grandparents usually have more time than a young family, and they are very eager to have contact with their child. They may enjoy filling out their first memory book. The grandparents will also find the record of their child's development in the book helpful, because many grandparents, after many years of being young parents themselves, have forgotten what it is like to have a baby and how babies develop into toddlers. It is a great pleasure for them to recall this old knowledge, and also the memories of their own children that come to mind. <p/> A gift at birth It is also a good idea to give a first memory book to the parents-to-be or the new parents. You don't always have to give knitted slippers and two bodysuits, and there are bound to be a few teddy bears before the new parents can buy the first one to their liking. It is much better to be original and give a first memory book that the young family will enjoy for years after they have received it. <p/> Get your first memory book as a gift with a new subscription to My Toddler magazine.",Promotion

"Sometimes when I go to Celje, I see it frozen in that bronze. With a suitcase. Then I go to McDonald's, and Alma just stands there and seems to have got used to the city. And the city has (at least a little) got used to her. It's been a long time since I found her. Or rather, she found me. That's what one girl, a fortune teller, said when I told her the story. Namely, Alma died on the same day I was born. Not the same year, but the same day of another year. She died in Sveta, I was born in Sveta. She was buried covered in white paint, which somewhere in Haiti, or wherever, means reincarnation. <p/>Of course, it would be foolish for me to claim now that I am the reincarnation of Alma Karlin, because I am probably the reincarnation of some perfectly ordinary animal. But it was crazy the year I dealt with it. I was the first one to find her and dig her out of oblivion. People knew her, some individuals, but I was the first to bring all the knowledge about her together in a documentary. Then they rushed after it, ""Oja"", they rushed. Feminists, actors, sociologists, literary historians... and they discovered her, it was a joy. But this has been happening to me all my life. I find someone or something, I introduce it to the public, and then everyone else takes credit. Because I'm an unambitious shit-baker from Svečina. <p/> Alma was then presented as a heroine, a theosophist, a traveller, a Nobel Prize candidate, blah, blah, blah. She was one confused lady who travelled around the world and kept yammering about why she was travelling around the world. Apart from that, she wrote badly, or rather mediocrely. And she made things up. And she was German and at least a little homosexual... For me, Alma will remain, the memory of the day when I was wandering around the ruins of her hut, there under the stumps of the Celje castle, and it was as if I was knee-deep in some strange, chaotic fate.",Opinion/Argumentation

"UNICEF boosts support for education in the Horn of Africa as school year begins <p/> Nairobi, 9 September 2011 - UNICEF has boosted support for children's education in drought-affected countries in the Horn of Africa as the new school year begins. <p/> 13.9.2011 <p/> ""Schools and children's centres play an important role not only in basic education, but also in delivering life-saving messages on nutrition, hygiene, sanitation and health education - all vital skills for survival in today's Horn of Africa,"" said Elhadj As Sy, UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa. <p/> ""In refugee camps, schools are also accessible to girls and other vulnerable children who may never have set foot in a classroom before,"" added Elhadj As Sy. ""In vulnerable communities, school facilities also provide access to clean water, sanitation, nutrition programmes and safe spaces where children are protected from violence and abuse. ""<p/> In the affected countries of the Horn of Africa, crucial support to the school system was already provided before the start of the new school year: <p/> In Kenya, many schools were opened in drought-affected areas, including during the holidays, to provide access to nutrition programmes for 1.2 million children. In Somalia, 155 schools were opened with UNICEF support, supporting 37,000 children <p/> Since 2010, 28,000 children living in drought-affected areas have been able to access education through alternative school facilities and supplies <p/> Since the beginning of 2011, UNICEF has supported the education of some 120,000 displaced children in Somalia. More than 300,000 children will be supported in the coming months, including those attending one of the 1,500 rural schools in central and southern Somalia. In these areas, priority assistance will focus on the provision and establishment of long-term services for children who have remained in their hometowns or will return <p/> UNICEF's education partners are establishing child-friendly facilities for children to access clean water, food vouchers, adequate sanitation and psychosocial support. By 15 September, 350 child-friendly facilities for more than 30,000 children will have been set up in collaboration with partners. <p/> In Kenya, UNICEF, together with partners in schools and day-education centres, has provided equipment and supplies for more than 60,000 children to date - including beds, mattresses, school supplies and sports and recreation equipment. <p/> In Ethiopia, UNICEF and partners have provided temporary child-friendly spaces and school supplies for some 8,000 children.In addition, UNICEF facilitated the construction of four primary schools in Dollo Ado refugee camp and in two local communities where people from the affected areas have taken refuge <p/> In Dadaab refugee camp in north-eastern Kenya, UNICEF stepped up its support to children's education ahead of the new school year and reached out to needs on the ground, by providing school tents and supplies <p/> The current drought crisis in the Horn of Africa poses an enormous challenge for children's education in all affected countries.

"5 reasons why coworking is a great solution <p/> In Slovenia, we have recently witnessed the rise of so-called coworking offices, which allow young entrepreneurs more flexibility than working in traditional offices, and are also more affordable, which is especially important for young companies. And they have many other advantages! <p/> 5 reasons why coworking is a great solution (Image source: sxc.hu) <p/> Coworking is a great solution for young businesses,... <p/> ... because you can separate work and family more easily. <p/> Many of today's very successful entrepreneurs have started their businesses in their own homes, whether in a dusty basement or in their living room. The fact is that young entrepreneurs start out with very limited funds, so renting their own office space is usually too expensive for them. <p/> This is why renting office space in a so-called coworking office, which is especially suitable for young companies with few team members, comes into play. These offices are much more affordable than traditional offices and allow the entrepreneur to easily separate home and office space. <p/> ... because you can build a real network of friends. <p/> Coworking offices bring together several entrepreneurial teams from very different business areas in one place. By renting office space in a coworking office, you will automatically become a member of the community and you will build a real network of friends. In this way, you will spread the word about your company and make new good friends. <p/> ... because doing business can be much faster and easier. <p/> Doing business in a coworking office is not only interesting and fun, it can also be much faster and easier. Need a programmer, a designer, an accountant? Don't worry, you'll probably find one in the next room, but if you can't find one, ask the other members of the coworking office for their contact numbers and recommendations, as they've probably used the services before. <p/> ... because working in an office is much more comfortable than working in a nearby pub. <p/> Laptops and almost unlimited access to the internet allow many entrepreneurs to work from different locations. One option that many people with space problems use is to work in a café with a cup of coffee or tea. The problem arises if the owners of the café do not approve of this and the entrepreneur has to leave the place... and let's not even waste words on the effectiveness of such work. <p/> You may be comfortable working from home, but your business partners or potential clients will be much more impressed if you meet them in a tidy office instead of in a room that is also your bedroom or kitchen. Prove to your clients and business partners that you are a serious person who does your job professionally.",Promotion

"12.5.2014 <p/> The healing properties of yoghurt <p/> Yoghurt is very healthy as it is full of calcium and protein, and is easier for our bodies to digest than milk. <p/> 1. Yoghurt is an excellent source of calcium and protein. Calcium is needed for healthy bones, so yoghurt should be consumed especially by the young and the elderly. In addition, yoghurt contains twice as much protein as milk, which our bodies need to function properly. <p/> 2. If our digestive system is healthy, it will absorb all the vitamins, minerals and other substances it needs from food. But for the digestive system to function properly, we also need food to keep it healthy. Yoghurt is one of the foods that has the most positive effect on our digestion, so make sure you include it regularly in your diet. <p/> 3. Yoghurt also boosts the immune system as it contains cultures of living organisms. These boost our body's defences, so when we are stressed or it is cold outside, we should eat yoghurt to protect our bodies against illness. <p/> 4. Some people find milk very difficult to digest because of the lactose. Yoghurt contains much less of it and scientists have shown that this makes it easier to digest. So anyone with digestive problems should eat at least one plain yoghurt a day.",Promotion
"In every profession there are people who are more and those who are less friendly. But when dealing with customers, you should not be unfriendly, arrogant or even rude. Nurses come top in these qualities (in my experience). From the fact that one nurse, during the driving test, tried every means to convince me that I was anaemic - she did not even ask me if I was, which is what she said: ' You are anaemic, you are so anaemic. ' And she did not give up even after several assurances that I was not anaemic. Apparently it is difficult to understand that blond and blue-eyed people also tend to have less pigment in their skin. The height of rudeness is the nurse at my gynaecologist's (a woman who the whole medical establishment knows to be a tease), who gives you a hard time whether you do anything wrong or not. The desire to get a prescription for the pill on a day when they are working with normal clients and not with students is utopian with her. If you explain to her nicely that you are studying more than 100 km away and that you cannot come on a specific day, she tells you to go and see the man on duty on Saturday. That's logic for you. Also, as a student, I can only get an appointment over the phone on Monday (that's the day they have reserved for female students), not any other day of the week. Someone please explain this to me. <p/>The waiters have been in a bad mood for the last week. First I get several accusatory no's because I want to order food that is out of stock (how was I supposed to know it was out of stock! ? ! ), then my classmate and I are told to get our own Coke from the fridge. Serving at the table is obviously a utopia. Whereupon we are given glasses full of limescale, which they refuse to change because apparently they can't be washed any nicer. But I wash the glasses by hand and they are never full of limescale. Then, suddenly, a waiter thinks that rum tea is great if you make it with black tea. Well, it's not great, and I have used an extravagant amount of sugar to make it edible at all. How a waitress who cannot make either can work in a bar where there is a big sign outside saying mulled wine and hot chocolate, and who cannot make either remains an enigma to me. Especially since at least mulled wine is very easy to make ... <p/> Certain people think that customers need to understand that they are having a bad day. Unfortunately, I have never considered that to be the customer's task. If I myself am polite and friendly and don't complicate things (except in extreme situations), I expect kindness in return. Or at least the absence of unkindness. Not unnecessary complication, nagging and insults. Because I believe that these same run-of-the-mill nurses and waiters would not find it acceptable if one day they came to see me as a client (e.g. in my capacity as a psychotherapist or clinical psychologist) and I was rude to them because I was just having a bad day. No matter how difficult it may be, worries should be left at home, or at least not shaken at clients.",Opinion/Argumentation

The whole amount has to be raised by 20.5, because Dr. Paley is coming to Milan for other commitments, it is purely his will to operate Rene, he just decided to operate one child, that's how much time he will take. furthermore, one boy is already in the game, if the parents of the other boy have the money before, he will be operated and not Rene. It is now a matter of days and a large sum to raise. Negative comments only minimize the fight to save his leg. This is about a little child, not some old grandfather.

Of course we paid, but ! ! ! ! ! At that amount, we are not even worth a Slovene translation... But at all... "" our "" opinion was translated before it was sent to Boston. But the opinion from Boston made it clear that they did not deliver some of the "" foreign "" reports ! Because they asked for this and that. The child had made those enquiries, and Boston did not know about them. So... Having healthy children is a great treasure. Many parents with healthy children are probably not aware of this. <p/>I hope that everything is really going to be the best for Rene. It's already terrible that he has to go through all this, that such a young child has to go through all this - and his family with him -... But, you know, there's one other thing I remember about Rene's leg: one child I know went to the orthopaedic surgeon from the age of 6 - because one of his legs was shorter. They followed him for quite a number of years after that. They observed, they did some tests. And then once there was another doctor. And he said that he needed surgery on the tibia (shortening of the bone on one leg and that they would see him another time to find out exactly what the operation would be. At the second check-up in about two months. But at the second check-up it was the old doctor again... who just laughed at the opinion of the previous doctor... and said they would wait. Well, now it's been more than 10 years since then and this person doesn't even go for check-ups anymore, and there hasn't been any surgery either. Fortunately, it was not necessary. My mother is horrified at the thought that if the previous doctor had been back for a follow-up, the child might have been operated on.... <p/>I hope you have so much to take away that it is very clear what is really best for Rene. <p/> # 16 <p/> AMelaTalic <p/> 1 <p/> Apr 28, 2014 <p/> Ana: we also had a similar experience when we asked for an MRI, because of the ligaments and other things that are not visible on the X-ray pictures, and the doctor said that when he needed it, he would order it. :( And the ZZZS offered us 25€ to cover the examination in Belgium, which cost 500€ plus transport, accommodation,... <p/> A few years ago we were looking for a second opinion for our child abroad... it wasn't free, we had to pay for everything and when I told the doctor who arranged it all if we could get an opinion in Slovenian, she said if we paid extra. The state should be prepared to pay for such things. It pays for all sorts of nonsense... :( <p/> There is a page on fb for Rene.... (no, I didn't make it)... there will be everything you are interested in in several languages up there all the time. You can like, share, contribute with conversations, support, or just follow what's going on (to avoid misinformation, eh). Link: https: / / www.facebook.com / helpajmoreneu <p/> Hi, I'm AMela, mum from Rene. If you know anyone who would publish the story, I am willing to publish all the exams, especially the last one, in which we are advised amputation as the only treatment option! Also Paley's report, in which 100 guarantees a successful reconstruction of the leg. I cannot influence the opinion of the Health Insurance Fund, just as I cannot influence the opinion of the people, there are all sorts of us, but anyway, as far as I personally know parents with similar problems, none of them has managed to take advantage of it so far! This is yet another ugly innuendo circulating and smearing such campaigns. In any case, I doubt that anyone would publicly expose the results, their child, all their personal data, in order to then go on holiday to Hawaii. Children with special needs need a lot of money on a daily basis. I will give you a trivial example: we have one pair of shoes every 9 months paid for by the National Health Insurance Fund, and that is at an extra cost of 40! We still have the first adapted pair of shoes since birth, and the child is almost two years old! How many pairs of shoes have your children already changed in such a period, slippers, boots, etc.? ? Not to mention children who have more serious problems such as cerebral palsy and so on. If someone guarantees me from the ZZZS that they will pay all the costs of the operation (180.000) + rehabilitation + stay abroad + travel expenses, I sign immediately and I donate all the money that has accumulated so far at the same moment to the association Joyful Feet (children with cerebral palsy), or to some other child who needs an operation and is not covered by the ZZZS. I have a clear conscience, and I hope that others can say the same. I have been deciding to tell my story for a long time, having considered all the possible scenarios that could befall us in the meantime - from rejection, to partial co-financing, even daring to dream that there will be someone who will pay for everything and I will finally be able to breathe easy and take the next step without this financial burden standing around my neck. This is about a child, thank you to all of you who are helping us and who will continue to help us, and if anyone needs any more papers, documents, proof, my contact details, address, telephone, e-mail are posted above, I will send them without any problems. Greetings, AMela <p/> The whole process is described daily by my mum Amela on her fb wall. She also has all the documents, not me. The health service here would only cover an amputation, which is what she was advised. But for the surgery abroad, they are squinting and saying that she will get an answer in (the legally required? ) 60 days. And even that may only be a fraction, a percentage. As for the rest.... the campaign is in full swing, the blog is just my modest contribution to the mosaic. <p/> Give a little more information. There have been quite a few cases recently where parents had the option of covering the costs through the NHIF, but still raised the money and then spent people's contributions on "" their own "". To avoid this, I advise you to calm down a bit and try to publish as many documents as possible (refusals, decisions) so that people will dare to transfer money. If the case is really as you describe it, it is necessary to involve journalists and make the matter public (Tednik, for example). I write in good faith that something will come of it, otherwise nothing will! <p/> But would at least one of those who have 10 million in assets, or 5 million in cash in foreign banks and safe-deposit boxes (eh, Milan) at least donate 10,000 euros in aid? Will it work? It will be easier to croak. I guarantee him that he will die easier!",Forum

"Are systematic examinations really compulsory? <p/> At the Association for Freedom of Choice, we are receiving an increasing number of indignant letters from parents informing us of the unacceptable practice of paediatricians and school doctors in cases where a child is not brought for a systematic check-up. Some parents are even threatened with reporting to the CSD for ""neglecting"" their child, while others are told that they will no longer be their doctor of choice if they do not come for a check-up (even if the child is healthy! ). Clearly, there is increasing pressure on parents from paediatricians and some state institutions, which is not least reflected in increased dissatisfaction and resistance from parents. <p/> The health centre is threatening one family directly in writing - without any legal basis! - that if they do not bring their baby for a systematic check-up, the Social Work Centre will be sent to their door. In the accompanying document, I am sending you an official clarification from the Ministry of Health (from January 2011), which makes it clear that systematic examinations are a RIGHT in Slovenia and that they are NOT MANDATORY. <p/> What is the situation with these systematic examinations now, are they compulsory (ZZVZZ) or not (statements of the Ministry of Health)? Do you get the CSD by the scruff of the neck in this country if you don't go for such a check-up? Where and why, who gives them this right to send the CSD over parents and de facto impose systematics as compulsory? Are such threats and pressures from doctors and the state permissible? <p/> We believe that this is an intensive increase of pressure on parents beyond all permissible limits, and therefore civil society movements are considering a form of public protest against the intensification of repression against parents by paediatricians and the state. If we fail to stop this - will soon every parent who fails to turn up with their child for a systematics session receive threats or even a CSD hearing? <p/> This practice by paediatricians and other actors in the health sector is contrary to legislation and guidelines for good practice for paediatricians, as well as to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the Republic of Slovenia is in flagrant breach of by failing to regulate this area by law. <p/> Article 18 emphasises that the primary responsibility and care for the growth and development of the child in all respects belongs to the parents (or in special cases, legal representatives), and the best interests of the child are the primary parental concern. In order for parents to be able to achieve this goal, States Parties must provide them with appropriate support and establish institutions and services that parents can use to achieve this goal. Article 24 highlights the right of the child to enjoy the highest standard of health and to have access to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. It is the role of the State to ensure access to these facilities and technologies and to ensure that all segments of society, especially parents and children, are informed about these options, have access to education about them and to basic knowledge about child health and nutrition, the benefits of breastfeeding, hygiene and a clean environment, and disaster prevention. Nowhere in the Convention does it say that families must submit to compulsory procedures in the area of preventive health and medical examinations and interventions. The fact is that, because of pressure from paediatricians, a good number of Slovenian parents are already going abroad for check-ups, mainly to Austria. There, many parents are even asked what they have come for, because the child is healthy and, in their opinion, would not need so many examinations. More proof that something is very wrong in Slovenia. <p/> It is also a fact that recently the CSDs have taken children away from some families for similar reasons. Will we parents have to fear our own country in future? If you find this topic interesting, we invite you to contact our association for more information, the contacts are listed below. Above all, the Ministry of Health owes the Slovenian public an immediate clarification on all this.",Opinion/Argumentation
"Trampling on the Constitution instead of taking responsibility <p/> The Information Commissioner has caught the police illegally obtaining data on the readers of online portals. Instead of taking responsibility, the ministry wants to legalise the actions of the police. Even though they are against the Constitution. <p/> If someone is warned that his actions are breaking the law, if he is reasonable, he will stop those actions. The police and the Ministry of the Interior see things slightly differently - instead of stopping illegal activities, they would legalise them. Even if this legalisation is contrary to the Constitution. <p/> But let us take it in turn. In January this year, we published a report by the Information Commissioner on the podcrto.si website, which found repeated illegal behaviour by the police in obtaining data from web portal operators. In the vast majority of cases, the police have requested information on the identity of readers and commenters on online portals from portal operators without a court order. However, the Act on Electronic Commerce on the Market stipulates that the police can only obtain such information with a court order. However, according to the Information Commissioner's findings, in 2012 the police obtained information on readers only four times with a court order. In the remaining 31 cases, it requested it bypassing the courts. <p/> Much of the media did not pay attention to these findings. This is understandable - in 23 cases, the media operating online portals provided the police with the identity of their readers, even though they did not have a court order to do so. In this way, they themselves were complicit in breaking the law. <p/> What is more surprising is the reaction of the police and the Ministry of the Interior, which is the superior authority of the police. Instead of holding the police accountable and punishing the guilty for repeatedly breaking the law, they have responded to the Information Commissioner's findings by creatively interpreting the law, which may, after all, allow them to obtain information bypassing the courts. This is how they brought to light Article 149b of the Criminal Procedure Act. The third paragraph of this article gives the police the possibility to request from operators, only at their written request, information on the owner or user of a particular means of electronic communications traffic which is not published in the subscriber directories. The intention behind the legal latitude is simple: the legislator wanted to make the police's job easier in cases where the police have the telephone number of a suspect but cannot find out his name because the number is not in the telephone directory. However, the police and the Ministry of the Interior have interpreted the provision creatively: operators of online portals could also be considered operators, and therefore they are obliged to provide data even without a court order. <p/> This lifeline of the police was eventually broken by the latter, after a series of correspondence between the Ministries of Justice, Economy and Higher Education, Science and Technology to establish the definition of an operator. It said that the Electronic Communications Act defines an operator as someone who manages a communications network. This, of course, is not what the web portals do. The MoI has now run out of excuses, and so at the end of February it admitted to the Information Commissioner that in almost all cases of data extraction the police had acted illegally. <p/> But the story does not end here. The MoI has decided to legalise the illegal activities of the police. By amending the Criminal Procedure Act (ZKP). The proposed amendment to the CCP, which is currently undergoing inter-ministerial coordination, would thus include service providers in the aforementioned Article 149b(3). According to the interpretation of the MoI, this would also require operators of web portals to provide information to the police only upon written request. This would make the hitherto unlawful practice legal. <p/> But there is one problem with this argument - the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. As the Information Commissioner points out, Article 37 of the Constitution guarantees the secrecy of letters and other communications, and only the law may prescribe that, on the basis of a court decision, the protection of the secrecy of letters and other communications and the inviolability of human privacy may be waived for a certain period of time if this is necessary for the initiation or conduct of a criminal proceeding or for the security of the state. Furthermore, in its 1997 decision, the Constitutional Court ruled that it is not only the content of the communication, i.e. the content of a letter, that is guaranteed, but also the circumstances of the communication, i.e. who communicated with whom and when. Thus, information about who accessed or commented on an internet portal is also constitutionally protected communication data. The police can therefore only obtain it by court order, no matter what law they write. This is because the Constitution, as the supreme law, is above the law. And given the experience of the Yugoslav secret services, it is understandable why the Constitution is so strict about obtaining communications data. <p/> The intentions of the police or the Ministry of the Interior in amending the Criminal Procedure Act are therefore worrying. Not so much from the point of view of the authorities' desire to make it easier to obtain data on the readers of online portals, but because of the intention to blatantly flout constitutional provisions. The latter are the cornerstone of the rule of law, and trampling on them puts us as a society in great danger. <p/> Therefore, if law enforcement authorities wish to obtain communications data bypassing the courts, they should pursue this desire through legal channels. By proposing an amendment to the Constitution. This route is, of course, infinitely more difficult than amending the law - it requires the consent of two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly. But it is the only permissible one. And it is the only one that would trigger a proper public debate on the proposed amendments. <p/> If the proposed amendment to the CPC were nevertheless adopted, and the police then started to obtain communications data bypassing the courts, in violation of constitutional provisions, we would face another problem. Evidence obtained in this way will not be taken into account by the courts, as it will have been obtained illegally. For example, the actors in the Balkan Warrior case were acquitted because of illegally obtained evidence. In court, the police were unable to explain how they obtained the telephone numbers of the defendants, who were then wiretapped. The numbers were not made public. Under the Constitution, it would have had to prove that it had obtained them legally - either by court order from the mobile phone operator or by some other legal means, such as from police colleagues. The judges then ruled as they were obliged to do under the Constitution and the law. They threw out the illegally obtained wiretaps and acquitted most of the defendants. According to the then Director of the Criminal Police Directorate, Jurij Fermet, the police were ""shocked"" by the verdict. Well, history is repeating itself now, and new shocks seem to be just around the next corner.",Opinion/Argumentation

"Which foods are good to eat together and which are not <p/> It is often food combinations that complicate the metabolism. If we don't eat the right combinations, even healthy foods don't help us. <p/> 1. Don't eat protein and starch together Avoid eating simple carbohydrates and protein in one meal. Do not combine bread, rice and cereals with fish, eggs, meat, milk and dairy products. The body needs an alkaline base to process starch and acids to process protein. This combination causes bloating, abdominal pain, indigestion, etc. <p/> 2. Eat protein only with vegetables <p/> 3. Eat starch only with vegetables Combine starchy foods such as rice, potatoes and pasta only with vegetables. <p/> 4. Fruit Eat fruit 2 hours before, or after a meal. Fruit is so special in every way that you will gain the most from digesting it on its own. It is important that fruit triggers the fermentation process, which in combination with other foods can interfere with other metabolic processes. Be careful with melons. Melons are faster to digest than other fruits, so be careful when mixing fruits together. <p/> 5. Don't mix starch and sugar Cookies can be really hard to resist, but when you mix starch and sugar in your mouth, enzymes are secreted to break down the starch, and the sugar makes your body acidic. Acidity slows down the breakdown of starch and you are trapped in an unsolvable digestive loop. <p/> 6. Do not combine milk with anything Pasteurisation destroys the enzymes that stimulate digestion. Milk starts to coagulate when it reaches the stomach and this slows down the digestion of other foods. Of course, this applies only to cow's milk. <p/> 7. Avoid sugar The problem of sweets is even greater because most of us already have a portion of protein, starch and carbohydrates in our stomachs. All of this further complicates digestion. In this case, we like to say that some food is stuck in our stomach, which is actually true, because the metabolic methods are mutually exclusive. You may have heard somewhere that it would be better to eat desserts half an hour before a meal. The benefit would be twofold: a large part of your metabolism would have been done by the time you had your main meal, and you would be less hungry and eat less. <p/> vkj",Instruction

Unfortunately, even after all these months, and especially after the intense discussions in recent weeks, we can only conclude with sadness that we will not be welcoming spectators this year either, and that the measures that were in place in December are still in force. This means that everyone taking part in this competition will be staying in a so-called snow hut. Two areas will be set up, the so-called green area and the grey area. Protected areas in which the competition will run as smoothly as possible. The media regime will be similar to that in December. It applies both to work in the media centre and in the mixed zone. <p/> We have also worked quite a lot on the idea, which was already alive in December, of spectators watching the Alpine Skiing Competition from vehicles. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm this here today either. Not only the large amounts of snow we have received this winter, but also the epidemiological situation in Slovenia and in wider Europe is not yet good enough to make this possible. With our loyal sponsor, Zavarovalnica Triglav, we have once again prepared the so-called virtual fan stand, which will be located at the exit of the Goriška Brothers Airport. There, virtual spectators will be able to tune in to the competition itself via a remote meeting tool. I would already like to invite all interested parties to register on the triglav.si/planica website. There they will then wait for the call to watch the match. <p/> Planica will be different from everything we have already tried in December. These experiences have been very rewarding. The regime will be similar, but we learned a few things then. Despite the stricter requirement in Slovenian law that all participants in sporting events must be tested every 48 hours, we will stick to it. The extra day of competition makes the risk of infection even greater. We do not want this to happen at the start of the season. We want to maintain our reputation as a good, excellent organiser and that is why this decision has been taken. The rules for World Cup ski jumping competitions in the FIS family are slightly different and in some points even stricter than we are used to elsewhere. <p/> At the moment we have 16 teams registered. Approximately 186 people are on the accreditation list. Access to the valley will be restricted from this weekend. Initially there will be a partial restriction, but from Monday onwards the valley will be virtually closed to all outside visitors. Access will be restricted to accredited persons only. <p/> Preventive measures against covid-19 remain in place. Call for distance, wearing FFP2 masks at all times and disinfection! This is absolutely in place. Please adhere to it, everyone. <p/> As a point of interest, if we hosted the games under floodlights in December, the games during the week will be held in the afternoon, but still in daylight conditions. And with TV Slovenia's TV coverage, we will once again provide additional attractive spots, so this time the coverage from Planica will also be something special. I can say that I have a proof copy of the book that will be published on the occasion of this year's Plania competition. I am sure it will be very well received by everyone. The Goriška brothers are fatally linked to Planica and Planica to them. This is one more moment of this year's Planica. <p/> The budget this time is a few euros short of EUR 1.5 million. If we compare this with the classic finals in previous years, it is as much as half as much. We have had to work very hard to turn every euro around and spend it as economically as possible so that the final calculation shows a positive zero. Unfortunately, the absence of spectators has resulted in a loss of approximately 35% of revenue. If we add to this the loss made last March, the situation is not enviable, but it is not unmanageable. We and our team at OK Planica will do our utmost to successfully eliminate this loss. In addition to our loyal sponsors, who have stood by us all these years, I would like to thank the Ministry of Defence, the Slovenian Armed Forces and, of course, the Slovenian Police, who, with their members, always make sure that Planica is as it is, as we are used to it, and I believe that it will be special this time too, although it will be different, because the spectators will not be able to come to the valley below Ponce. <p/> Aljoša Dolhar, Competition Manager <p/> I feel a certain amount of responsibility. This year, from the very beginning, the preparations have been a bit different than usual. We had a specific situation and we had three types of snow on the airfield. We had about 4000 cubic metres of snow left over from the March event, which we stored and then used in December. A lot of natural snow fell on top of that. We estimate the quantity to be around 12 000 cubic metres. In addition, we produced about 5,000 cubic metres of artificial snow. During the winter races, in cooperation with NC Planica, we kept the ski jump and the run-off area tamped, the snow compacted, mixed and, above all, prevented from sliding. On the downhill run, we also kept the ski from December. Only this one had to be cleaned and re-cut. The situation at the moment is such that today we have started removing the spare snow that we had stored in the run-out. We are spreading the snow on the runway with a tamping machine. We have the skis practically ready, so we are just waiting to open them and start using them. We will be ready with the machine work on Friday afternoon. We are planning a big operation on Saturday and Sunday with our team to get everything ready for the test on Tuesday. <p/> Today and tomorrow in Planica there are optional training sessions for the pre-competitors. After tomorrow we will form a team of 20-25 jumpers who will jump next week. On Tuesday at 15:30 we expect the first series of the aerodrome test. The second series is planned for 17:00, so that we can test the visibility and conditions at the same time. As far as the weather forecast is concerned, I have to say that it is quite favourable at the moment. From Tuesday onwards we expect stable weather, with moderate temperatures. At night it will be -5 to -8, which will make our work easier. Daytime temperatures will range from 2 to 8 degrees. The weather will be partly clear to mainly cloudy, which is better than very clear. I hope this forecast is accurate. Wind conditions should also be very stable. The weather is also very good for us at the moment. Who will jump first will be known after tomorrow's practice. <p/> This year in Planica the whole jury of the competition will change, not only the competition director. There is also a change of TD and ATD. We will see what this means on Sunday after the competition. The Technical Delegate will be Ivo Greger from the Czech Republic, who I understand has no experience with flying, but is an experienced TD. His assistant is my assistant on the flights, Thomas Hasselberger from Germany. We have worked well together at all the airshows and I hope that this will make a difference and that we will work harmoniously as a jury.",Opinion/Argumentation
"MANUAL THERAPY (J.Cyriax method) <p/> The Cyriax method is one of the most internationally recognised methods in the field of manual therapy. Unlike classical physiotherapy, this method is based on a detailed physiotherapeutic examination by which the therapist identifies the origin of problems in the locomotor system. Based on the information gathered and with the patient's cooperation, the therapist decides on the most appropriate manual therapy technique. Each step of the treatment is based on years of experience of renowned therapists. Cyriax therapy is constantly evolving and keeping pace with new developments in both the medical and manual therapy fields. <p/> In addition to acute problems, manual therapy can also have a beneficial effect on so-called degenerative joint disorders, especially on the effects that these disorders have on the musculoskeletal system.

"27.09.2006 I find the title question interesting. Sometimes it seems to me that most people do not even ask it, because we live in a more or less school-taught and almost taken-for-granted belief that we judge things, people, their actions and events on the basis of the facts and by using our own common sense. And, accordingly, many people would probably answer the question posed by the title by saying that it is the authority of the argument that applies to them, not the other way round. But is this true? And how about in law? Are we persuaded by arguments or by the authority of the person who presents them? <p/> With the New Age and the tradition of the Enlightenment, the belief in human reason (ratio) became firmly established in Western society. This was particularly due to the development of the natural sciences, which, with their (apparent) exactitude, in many respects inspired legal thinkers. In particular, the proponents of the rationalist view of natural law, according to which the fundamental principles of law are somehow axiomatically rooted in ordinary human reason, believed that from the (highest) principles of law (e.g. neminem laedere or pacta sunt servanda) the correct solution to any legal problem or question could be found by deductive reasoning. This almost ""mathematical"" conception of law also led to the belief that legal reasoning is done by demonstration, i.e. by illustrative and formal logical demonstration or proof. However, after the more modern natural sciences have disproved the belief that science can be purely exact, and after the relativistic world-view (which is also known from many earlier historical periods, e.g. from the time of ancient Greek sophism) has regained a large measure of its right of homeland in the social sciences and law, faith or trust in the method of legal demonstration has in many respects also been dispelled. In its place, especially in the second half of the last century, the idea of legal argumentation came to dominate the field of legal logic. Although the term 'demonstration' is still used in many places in law and more widely today, it is in fact increasingly used to mean persuasion. Since, as I have written in various places, everything is relative in space and time, so is (i.e. relative) all (legal) evidence. A fact is prima facie evidence of guilt for one person, but not for another. If nothing else, a fact can be shown in a completely different light than it was previously shown in a narrower context, simply by expanding the (temporal, spatial, mental, emotional, etc.) context in which it is observed. <p/> All this is particularly familiar to lawyers. What is pure and indisputable truth to one litigant is pure and indisputable falsehood to the other litigant, the facts being the same but the human interpretations of those facts (and indeed of the legal norms) being different. Of course, sometimes a so-called material fact can be completely indisputable in itself (e.g. the identification of an object, DNA or blood traces) and as such really proves something. But one can expand the context and say that in the process of identifying such a fact (e.g. identification of the murder weapon, the perpetrator or DNA) there was a mistake, or even conscious manipulation, lying, etc. Therefore, any evidence is only valid as such to the extent that it is convincing to those who judge it. Convincingness, however, is to a large extent related to our subjective perception and evaluation of the world around us. In law and in life in general, we are therefore constantly persuading ourselves. If we come across someone with similar values, education, etc. to our own, we will quickly click with them and the need for persuasion will diminish. In the opposite case, i.e. when we encounter a person with a completely different way of thinking and value worldview, even with the most obvious facts and evidence (in our opinion, of course), we will not be able to convince (much less ""prove"") that we are right about something. If you don't believe me, just start talking to people about politics. Put forward a few of your own claims that you think are based on demonstrable facts, preferably relating to denationalisation, redress, assessment of the current or previous government, etc. I think you will quickly come across someone whom you will not be able to convince of your ""facts"" or ""evidence"". <p/> Anyone who has managed to follow my train of thought up to this point (which of course is not necessarily the case) can now easily see that (as Kant might have said) facts are not only something we perceive, but above all something we (co-)create. It is therefore important to be as convincing as possible in relation to others and to ourselves in defining or evaluating facts, that is to say, to be able to argue our views and positions as well as we can. But now let us ask ourselves what I said in the title of this paper. Is it the authority of the argument or the argument from authority that is decisive for us? Are we more persuaded by a good, skilful, illustrative, comprehensible, etc. argument, or are we more persuaded by the authority of the personality of the person who is making the argument? <p/> The answer to the above question is, of course, by no means unambiguous, because the two are intertwined. But nevertheless, if we look a little deeper into the matter, we can quickly see that in life in general we trust the argument from authority to a markedly overwhelming degree. Just think about how many things in life we know enough about to be able to make reliable judgements about statements of fact that are explained to us by someone who knows better. Can we judge for ourselves the arguments put to us by a doctor, perhaps even a surgeon, a physicist, an architect, a builder, an electrician, this or that legal specialist, a historian, etc.? Is it not the case that we simply believe most of these people, trust them? And if we don't, then we find someone who does. And if someone we trusted disappoints us, we look again for someone else we can trust - a new dentist, mechanic, plumber, carpenter, lawyer, politician, etc. <p/> All this makes us realise the crucial importance of trusting people, not arguments. Since this is also extremely important for law, I will devote a future column to reflecting on the importance of trust in law, drawing on some of the thoughts presented here. For the moment, let me just say that anyone who thinks that they are guided to a greater extent by the authority of argument in judging things and people and their actions and behaviour is probably mistaken, because in reality we humans are predominantly following the authority of personality. In law, as in ethics, politics, religion and even science, we are in fact usually more persuaded by who than by what (although the two are in fact interdependent). If, for example, we are watching a controversial panel discussion on a topic on which we are more or less unfamiliar (or at least not sufficiently familiar with the relevant facts), then the persuasiveness of the persons presenting the arguments will play a decisive role in our decision as to which arguments are more persuasive. This persuasiveness is a certain emanation, a personal magnetism that people perceive according to their own (subjective) mental, energetic, emotional and other qualities. Of course, we should not overlook that this is a matter of sympathy, which means that we can only ever be represented in authority by someone who is close to us in what they do or represent, i.e. sympathetic in the true sense of the word.",Opinion/Argumentation

December is proverbially considered to be the busiest month of the year, but we can say that this weekend, despite the holidays and the resulting higher traffic density on our roads, did not stand out from the average. There was only one road accident resulting in serious injuries and two road accidents, two of which resulted in minor injuries to four occupants. 15 road accidents resulted in damage to property. Over the weekend, 19 drink-drivers were detained. <p/> A traffic accident with serious injuries occurred on Friday at 19:30 on Franja Malgaja Street in Šentjur. A 50-year-old driver was driving a car on Franja Malgaja Street in Šentjur, from the direction of Leona Dobrotinška Street towards II. Bataljona. As he drove his vehicle to the intersection with Gajstova cesta into a sharp right-hand bend, at the end of the bend he drove his vehicle too close to the right-hand edge of the carriageway and collided with a 63-year-old pedestrian, who was walking from the opposite direction, along the left-hand edge of the carriageway. After the collision, the pedestrian, who was wearing dark clothing, fell on the bonnet of the car and hit his head on the windscreen, after which he fell on the road and was seriously injured.

One of them was a novice driver. <p/> First of all, in the field of crime, a work accident. <p/> Yesterday, a 46-year-old Italian worker was injured while changing the support rope of a cable car at Golte. While loosening the grips of the bolts, one of the grips slipped against the rope and injured his hand. <p/> In Zreče yesterday we dealt with a fire in a commercial enterprise. It was caused by sparks on a sandblasting machine. The material damage amounts to about 5,000. <p/> A car was broken into on Mariborska cesta in Celje yesterday. The perpetrator took a handbag containing documents, cash and a phone, causing at least € 300 worth of damage to the owner. <p/> Police report <p/> 06.12.2010 <p/> We start the first report of the new working week in the area of road traffic. <p/> Fortunately, the weekend passed without any serious traffic accidents. However, in fifteen cases we dealt with traffic accidents with material damage. <p/> The figure for drivers detained is very worrying. From Friday until today, we have detained 24 of them and the alcohol levels of those detained were also very high. <We continue with a review of other developments. <p/> On Saturday, we were informed of the theft of a 2007 VW Golf, series 5, black. Unknown perpetrators took the car from the parking lot of Jenkova Street in Velenje. The owner estimates that he has been damaged by the theft for at least 13.000. <p/> On Saturday, a burglary was also dealt with in Boč, where a restaurant was broken into. A lawnmower and a compressor, both together worth around 500, are missing. <p/> In Celje, we dealt with two car break-ins over the weekend. A navigation device was stolen from a vehicle on Dečkova cesta. <p/> We conclude today's report with a tragic incident. Yesterday we dealt with a work accident in Podolševa in the area of the Mozirje Police Station. While cutting down a tree, the tree snapped in half and buried a 60-year-old local resident underneath.",News

"Slovenia: Public appeal by the Higher Education Trade Union of Slovenia <p/> Ljubljana, 16 June 2012 (MOREL) - The Higher Education Trade Union of Slovenia has addressed a public appeal to the government, the National Assembly, university rectors and faculty deans, and the National Agency for Quality in Higher Education, which we are publishing here in full: The results of the negotiations with the trade unions are very painful for public higher education. Because higher education is financed differently from secondary and primary education and because this financing has been carried out in an unconstitutional way for several years, universities have been left out of the negotiations. Not only has the state failed to adopt the law on the financing of state universities and colleges, which is required by the Constitution in its Article 58. It has crowned the unconstitutionality of the previous practice of funding by regulation by deciding the level of funding for higher education politically and arbitrarily, by rebalancing the budget. The State promises students free studies, while at the same time announcing tuition fees in the National Reform Programme. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly obvious that it is trying to artificially lower the quality of studies by putting financial pressure on public universities, thereby triggering the rampant privatisation of higher education. Universities have already had insufficient funds to carry out five years of study, and the new funding will be barely sufficient for the first level. In view of the financial constraints, the three public universities are already preparing to lay off fee-earners and temporary staff, to retire without replacements, and there are various ideas of radically reducing the rights deriving from titles, grades and employment contracts. These ideas culminate in unlawful proposals on unpaid additional teaching work, on supplementing full-time and additional teaching work with low-paid honorary work, and the demand that university teachers themselves provide universities with funds for the research part of their salary, which is already contractually due to them. This is roughly equivalent to requiring judges to generate part of their salary themselves on the market by securing a reasonable number of disputes in which to dispense justice. The non-recognition of research work and the expansion of self-financing part-time study could begin the uncontrolled disintegration of higher education as a public service. The work of higher education teachers and staff has always included both teaching and research. For a full-time or part-time employee, only the direct teaching commitment is defined; the remaining hours up to the full-time commitment comprise the indirect teaching commitment (preparation, examinations, tutoring, etc.), research (as demonstrated by meeting the habilitation criteria) and management work (membership of committees, etc.). The point of the legal regulation limiting the direct teaching obligation is that university teachers and staff are obliged to devote their regular working time to research, the results of which they must prove at the time of their election: every university teacher, with the exception of a minority of full professors, must be habilitated (elected to a title) every five years, and must meet demanding criteria for scientific work. Since habilitation resulting from research is a condition for maintaining employment, it is legally untenable for universities to make this same employment conditional on the independent acquisition of external research funding. The task of a university is not to reproduce existing knowledge, but to create and disseminate new knowledge. Therefore, basic research in universities must have stable sources of funding. The provision of these resources is to be laid down by law, in accordance with Article 58 of the Constitution. The Public Finance Balancing Act has allowed universities to modify their programmes autonomously. At first sight, it would appear that the State has thus given universities greater autonomy. In reality, however, it has given their managements all the power to rearrange, cut, merge and abolish study programmes at will. We would like to point out that such measures threaten not only employment, but also the quality of accredited programmes, the right of students to study in the programme in which they have enrolled and to pursue appropriate studies at a second level. We therefore call on the National Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Quality in Higher Education to problematise the reaccreditation of programmes if they are altered beyond recognition due to financial pressures or if they are implemented in a way that is not of the highest quality. Universities have insufficient human resources to carry out their studies, and at the same time the state, by withholding funds, is artificially creating a situation where there are suddenly too many staff. As this is a public service carried out in the interest of all the citizens of the Republic of Slovenia, we will initiate the appropriate legal procedures in relation to the undermining of the rights of public employees in universities. We would also like to point out that the rights of students are also at stake. If, under the financial conditions of the rebalancing, an agreement between the Ministry and the student organisation was possible, it is an agreement to destroy public higher education, the aim of which is rampant privatisation. The Ministry's promises that there will be no tuition fees are unconvincing hypocrisy, and the agreement with the official student organisation on free full-time study opens the door wide to the restriction of full-time study and the expansion of self-financing part-time study. The quality of studies will fall. Since the conditions for accreditation by the National Agency for Quality are low, opportunities will open up for private operators, who will be granted concessions by the state on the basis of easily obtained accreditation, according to the interests of individuals and political-economic clienteles. We propose that the National Agency for Quality tighten the conditions for institutional accreditation and demand an impact on the level of concessionary funding granted to HEIs. Above all, it is self-evident to require full funding for programmes already accredited, which are delivered as a public service and which have also been accredited on the basis of cost and staffing needs assessments. This includes professional, administrative and technical staff, who were already on low pay grades and have fallen even lower as a result of austerity measures. These categories of workers have hitherto enjoyed the basic rights that come with civil servant status, rights that may no longer be taken for granted in the forthcoming reorganisations. The State is deliberately depleting public higher education. In the words of the Minister, ""the government is forcing rectors to behave as any crisis manager would behave"". This statement is obscene and shows a complete lack of responsibility for a key area of development, as well as a lack of understanding of the social mission of universities and the constitutional role of higher education in the Republic of Slovenia. Recall that the autonomy of universities (Article 58 of the Constitution) is also to be interpreted by the Constitutional Court in the light of Article 59 of the Constitution, i.e. ""primarily as the autonomy of professors to research and teach autonomously (independently), without restrictions and pressures"" (U-I-34/94). Furthermore, as public servants, employees of higher education institutions perform a public service for the population of the Republic of Slovenia. Unfortunately, the government instead advocates a market-based approach, with an emphasis on corporate governance, consumerism and the pursuit of short-term profit. In this situation, we wonder whether universities will be able to fulfil their role? Will it be possible, in the face of financial cutbacks, to maintain the universal accessibility of education and the level of quality expected by students and employers? How is it possible that universities are playing an increasingly marginal role in the coming 'knowledge society'? The disintegration of higher education as a public service will not only affect the teaching and professional staff employed in universities. Profit-oriented higher education will inevitably widen the social divide between an elite minority who will be able to provide their children with a quality education, and thus with social status and security, and the vast majority of the rest of the population, who will either not be able to afford higher education or will be forced into long-term debt All this gives the unpleasant impression that university and college leaders have been too quick to bow their heads and accept political pressures. We know that crisis management is nothing more than the informal transformation of the university into a business that will serve neither the staff, nor the students, nor the economic and other development of the community, but the interests of local cliques. We therefore call on rectors and deans to firmly reject the destructive role assigned to them by politics and to open a broad public debate on the participation of workers and students in the governance of public universities. We remind university and faculty leaders that employees will not accept a situation in which external financial pressures become an excuse to promote political and private interests within the institutions themselves. We inform the government and the management of universities and faculties that, in a situation dictated by rebel budgets, we may be forced to suspend the study process already this calendar year. We call on students to support us in our efforts to achieve free and quality public higher education,"" said the appeal signed by Marko Marinčič. (end)",Opinion/Argumentation
"Rocker.si: Eva, in your long and successful music career you have made history with Make Up2, Laibach, The Stroj, Pointblack and many more. So why did you decide to form a new band? Where did the name Evil Eve come from, are you really Evil Eve? Evil Eve: The guys and I have known each other for a long time and our musical paths have intertwined in the past on various projects from Retrotaether to The Machine. It was kind of just a matter of time before we started our own band. The name Evil Eve came out of nowhere, but it's my nickname from high school. When we had almost all the songs for the album, we suddenly realised we didn't even have a name yet! That was the hardest choice for us. <p/> Rocker.si: The music is mostly written by Jure Golobič, but you're the one who takes care of the lyrics in the band? Your song ' No, I wouldn't, thank you ' has quite humorous lyrics, which at the same time contain just the right amount of provocation, will the rest of the lyrics go in that direction as well? Where do you draw inspiration for your lyrics? Evil Eve: I've worked with Jureto on several projects and I have a lot of respect for him as a writer. I think it's important that the songwriter and the composer are involved in the songwriting process itself and I'm not a fan of 'bespoke' or 'turnkey' songs. So Jure first creates the basis, then the lyrics are created simultaneously, for which I draw inspiration from the vibrations that the music itself gives me, combined with my own life experiences. Finally, we package it all together in rehearsals and each of us contributes a piece to the mosaic. The lyrics on the upcoming album, which is currently about halfway done, will reflect various themes in life - from relationships between men and women to relationships between people in general. <p/> Rocker.si: You recently appeared as a guest at a Requiem concert, losing your stage innocence, if I may say so myself. Kino Šiška is quite a big concert hall for a first show, what were the feelings before the concert? What were your expectations? Evil Eve: Considering that we were the first of two opening bands to play, and at 9pm, and we were still an unknown name on the stage, I was expecting a maximum of 5 people under the stage. When I saw the nice full house, I was shocked and happy at the same time. We didn't expect anything, we just wanted to play well, so the overwhelmingly positive reviews and reviews were a pleasant surprise and gave us even more motivation to keep going. <p/> Rocker.si: At the concert it was obvious that you put on a real show on stage. Among other things, you dressed up quite a few times, you performed as a 'seductive devil' or rather a real rock cat, and you even included a sexy dance by Teja Britovšek, which undoubtedly 'turns on' the male part of the audience... Do you think that the visual performance of the band is an important factor for the concert-goers? Evil Eve: Muses express themselves through all channels, not only through music - so also through photos, videos, stage presence, clothes, and last but not least through answers in interviews... I think it's important that it's consistent with who you are in private as well. I like artists who can offer concert-goers the whole package, not just the exact notes played - and it's not a case of 'bare affnaria': Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Pink - and not least Laibach - for example, do a great job of performing their music through all channels. The fact that Teja Britovšek performed alongside actor Bojan Bešter at the Kino Šiška concert was part of the promotion of our new video - they acted out one of the scenes and threw dollar bills off the stage, which of course has its own symbolism. We had a bit more of a show than usual at Kino Šiška, because it's a big stage. And a big stage allows, if not demands it. <p/> Rocker.si: Eva, does Evil Eve have an absolute advantage with you now over the other bands you also work with? Evil Eve: That's right, because it's my own project and the only band that I actually started - the others I joined later and helped as much as I could - and in Evil Eve I'm going to combine all the experience and knowledge I've gained over the last 10 years. This band was formed out of our common desire to gig and create, and we have accumulated enough original songs for at least two albums. So we will put all the songs through a sieve first and prepare a set of songs that will eventually find their place on the album. <p/> Rocker.si: You have already recorded songs for your debut album, when can we expect it? What will the title be? Can you tell us maybe some interesting details about your upcoming debut album? Evil Eve: The promotion of the single and the Ne bi hvala video put a bit of a crimp in our plans and took away the time that we would have otherwise spent on the further creation and mixing of the album, but since the track was accepted for the compilation album ' We Want Good Music ', we of course took advantage of it to introduce ourselves to a wider audience. We are planning to release the album in the spring, but we don't have a specific date, because we are doing everything mostly by feel and according to our time and financial possibilities - we all have jobs and we are giving all our free time to the band. <p/> Rocker.si: You also made a video for the song 'No, I Wouldn't, Thank You', which was censored by TV channels for being too sexual and some controversial footage. Did you expect that to happen? How did the idea for such a scenario come about? Evil Eve: The script and the direction were written and directed by Miha Knific, who we hold in high esteem as an artist, and we gave him full control. We are happy that he didn't just shoot the spot, but added his own artistic touch. I am surprised that the spot is being censored, because there are a lot of things in the media today that are really morally controversial. From boys pooing half-naked on the toilet in prime time to cartoons that are dominated by violence. The new cartoon by Micha Knific, 'The Little Chickadee Wants to Grow Up', for example, is a fine example of how I imagine a good, educational, child-friendly and appropriate cartoon to be. I do not understand what is so controversial about our spot. <p/> Rocker.si: Do you want to break down the taboos in Slovenia, which, to be honest, are obviously still there, through Evil Eve and music? Will you continue to look towards provocation and towards forbidden things? Evil Eve: I don't know if our video is too much of a provocation - I see it more as a product that forces the viewer to think about today's society and culture. Otherwise, the point of view from which the viewer sees the spot is actually revealing him/herself, and nakedly so! On the other hand, I wonder, from the point of view of the average viewer, what else is provocation for Eva Breznikar after 6 years with Laibach? The fact that a nun appears in the spot is certainly not, haha. As a band, we are mostly leaving ourselves to our musical imagination in the future and wherever the road takes us, it will take us. It's important to be creative, not calculating. We're staying in the pop-rock vein, although there will be some harder or more alternative stuff on the album. <p/> Rocker.si: What are your goals in the near future? How will you approach the Slovenian audience? Evil Eve: We are aware that no matter what point a band is at, there will be positive and negative reactions. Some people still look at me with a certain prejudice, but on the other hand it's also nice when someone comes to a gig for the first time and then apologises to me backstage, saying they 'made a little mistake'. Most of the prejudice comes from people who have never been to one of my concerts, but on various forums they can conveniently hide behind pseudonyms and make insulting comments without any valid arguments. On the other hand, many people also encourage us. Our goal at the moment is to release an album and we are devoting all our energy to that. We are happy that we have more and more supporters and the gigs are dripping nicely, although we didn't expect them until the album was released, especially in this recession. So it's all the more welcome that we already have a concert repertoire ready, although we are still adding to it, adding to it, taking away from it. <p/> Rocker.si: Eva, I've heard from you, among other things, that you also work as a designer of unique products under the name Evil Eve. Can you tell us more about that? What do you do, how do you do it, where do you sell your products? So you are the one who takes care of the visual image of the Evil Eve members? Evil Eve: I started designing because I was always on the hunt for good pieces to put on stage, and they're hard to come by here or they're too expensive. So I finally started to do it myself. I was encouraged by a friend of mine who has been making my clothes for the stage for many years and goes by the name Dictator Fashion Lab. Over the years of working together, she noticed that I always had enough ideas for new and different accessories and kept asking me why I didn't make a piece myself. I was very active in the arts since I was a little girl, so it was no surprise to those close to me that I finally started to create bouncy pieces in all sorts of materials - from gears to leather. My work can be seen on facebook.com/EvilEveDesign and it's my hobby alongside music. <p/> The visual image of the members is not my responsibility, but everyone's. My outfits are created by the Dictator Fashion Lab according to the ideas we have in advance together. Every now and then I make a piece for one of the guys. I made a hat for the guitarist and a leather tie for the keyboard player. The boys already have a style that they wear and live by themselves and in their private lives, and it fits nicely with our stage performance. But as a woman, I think it's nice not to have some scruffy, neglected hippies in the band who justify their lack of taste by saying that 'clothes don't matter'. A person's character is reflected in everything, including clothes and style and, last but not least, if you like, in what comes out of someone's mouth. To me, the guys in the band are more than just a band. I know that I can call any of them at midnight and ask for help if I need it. <p/> Rocker.si: You were known as a great swimmer, do you ever find the time to go to the pool, given how many things are going on in your life. Where do you get all this energy from to keep from burning out? Evil Eve: Everything I do comes from sport. Sport has given me more than just medals. I don't have time to go to the pool at the moment. And yes, sometimes I burn out. <p/> Rocker.si: And finally, what would you like to say to the readers of Rocker.si? Evil Eve: Don't judge people (and bands) until you've seen them with your own eyes and ears at a concert!",Interview
"Zdus to continue campaign of visiting MPs in their offices <p/> Ljubljana, 23 September (STA) - The Federation of Pensioners' Associations of Slovenia (Zdus) will continue the campaign of visiting MPs in their offices, which it started last week. The aim of the campaign is to make MPs more sensitive to the needs of their constituents, thereby raising the quality of decision-making in the National Assembly and restoring the National Assembly's reputation, the federation said. <p/> On the first day of the campaign last Monday, 16 September, 217 constituents took part, visiting 52 MPs and interacting with an additional 22 MPs. Ten MPs apologised, four did not attend the meeting despite having agreed to do so, two MPs did not want to meet constituents and 16 MPs were not contacted at all. <p/> Monday's meeting with MEPs was held under the slogan 'No pensions, no recourse'. According to V Zdus, they met with understanding and support from many MPs. However, they found that some were not yet ready to speak for themselves, but ""in the language of the party to which they belong"". <p/> The campaign will continue to present the real problems of the population to the MPs and to demand that they be addressed. The short-term objective of the campaign is to have all MPs available to constituents once a week by March 2014 and the medium-term objective is for constituents to get to know their MPs well by the 2015 elections. This would help them decide who to vote for in the National Assembly. ""Some MPs still do not have or do not have offices, and MPs receive a special allowance for their work in the field,"" points out Zdus.",News
"Honda's high-flying five-year plan <p/> Forecast. Honda has announced that it plans to double car production over the next five years, with a large number of new models expected to come to market, including in segments where it is currently absent. <p/>Honda's CEO Takanobu Ito said a few days ago that Honda plans to increase production to six million vehicles a year over the next five years from the current 3.1 million, with a number of new models planned, including in segments where it has not been present so far. <p/> Honda is therefore expecting a lot from the all-new generation of the Jazz, as well as from its smaller brother, the Brio, which will be aimed primarily at developing markets and will be a cheaper version of the aforementioned Jazz. To boost production, Honda plans to build new plants, one of which will be opened in Mexico by 2014, and will also focus on the Chinese market, where it plans to launch a maximum of 10 new models. <p/> The fate of the Accord in the European markets is still unknown, as Honda is not confident about the sales and profitability of the model in the old continent (photo: Honda) <p/> Much fewer new models in Europe <p/> While it is not yet known which of the new models will also enter the markets of the old continent, among the models announced are, in addition to the aforementioned brio and jazz, a smaller suv based on the latter, as well as a smaller sedan, which will be a replacement for the current Honda city. <p/> A sporty civica rally car has also been announced, which will, as usual, be given the Type-R nameplate, but enthusiasts will still have to wait until 2015 to get their hands on it. Much more numerous in terms of sales, however, will surely be the announcement of the new generation Accord, whose production for European markets is still in question for the time being, since the Accord has been a loss-making car in most European markets over the last few years, thanks to the strong yen. The same (unknown) fate in the European markets for the time being also awaits the A0 segment model, which will be called N-ONE in the Japanese markets. Among the models announced, we must not forget the NSX sports coupé, as well as the new sports roadster based on last year's EV-STER concept study. <p/> For the US markets, the acura RLX is also confirmed for the Los Angeles show in November, and is expected to arrive in Europe later in the form of the honda legend. For 2015, Honda has also announced a production version of the fuel cell model for European markets, not the FCX Clarity, but an all-new and significantly cheaper model. <p/> The Honda NSX is due to arrive in showrooms very soon, and we can also expect a new sporty roadster based on last year's EV-STER concept study, as well as a redesigned CR-Z hybrid coupé (photo: Honda). <p/> So, according to the announcements, the future of Honda on European soil in particular is still rather unclear, and not necessarily as rosy as it has been for quite a few years now.",News

"Select category <p/> Broken spoke <p/> Miha, 26 March 2012 <p/> My spoke broke on a hike. Not a very big mistake I tell myself, I'll fix it quickly. At home I look at the spoke, which didn't seem to be anything special, the length is one of the standard ones I think. I needed a 1,8 mm diameter spoke, 260 mm long. <p/> I start to surf the web, but somehow without any visible results. Clearly a component that sellers don't put in the online shop, well at least most don't. Much to my disappointment, apparently such a spoke is only made by NASA or some top secret military laboratory. Without exaggeration, I called 10 shops in Ljubljana and I did not get the case I wanted. All our dear sellers have are 2,0 or 2,0-1,8-2,0 diameter spokes (the middle thinned), of course they wanted to sell me the ones they have. The 11th shop had them in stock and my problem was almost solved. Picking a colour would have been a bold challenge to fate. It is even the case that they cannot even order spokes, some of the friendly salesmen checked with the importer. <p/> Not that a colleague had a similar problem not long ago. He couldn't buy the spokes he has on his Specialized from shops that sell the same bike. Some time ago I was looking for a spoke for a Kono Stab, where the spoke is of three different thicknesses.

"First documentary by Natalia Gros <p/> New Partisan Cinema in cooperation with Film Servis presents a new documentary on sport climbing, directed by Jureto Breceljnik, entitled Chalk & Chocolate. The film tells the story of Natalia Gros, one of the best climbers in the world, who takes on one of the most difficult routes in the country: Histerija (8c) in Mišja Peča. About a year ago, she became the fourth woman in the world to climb this difficult route. The camera follows Natalia's story both during the conquest of Histeria and during the competition season (training, competitions, injuries, testing). The filming started in December 2007, when Natalia first set out on the route, and the crew was with her from day one until the day she climbed the route. It shows both the tears and the joy, with the background of what it takes to achieve your dreams. Natalija started her climbing career at the age of 7 and has been one of the world's top climbers for many years. In 2007, she achieved the European title of her career, and became the most successful female sport climber of the season. Now that she has made her first film, she is thinking of swapping the climbing world for Hollywood when her career is over! <p/> The film has already been previewed at the 3rd International Mountaineering Film Festival 2009 at Cankarjev dom, where it received great applause and two awards. The jury awarded the film the Best Climbing Film prize for its concise and effective portrayal of the work, highs and lows of top climber Natalia Gros, and the Audience Award for Natalia's honest confession and perseverance. <p/> The documentary is also a success online. A clip from the Hysteria climbing film was uploaded to www.videoclimb.com, where it was voted the second best climbing clip of 2008 in the world.

"Spartacus, 4 June 2000, 0.10 <p/> original <p/> Cilician pirates <p/> translation <p/> Silesian pirates <p/> explanation <p/> The Silesians could have been miners at best. Silesia is a region on the border between Bohemia and Poland, far from any sea, famous, among other things, for its many mines. Spartacus, however, was betrayed by the Cilician pirates. Cilicia was an ancient province in the south of Anatolia, on the Mediterranean Sea. And a brief comment, lest anyone say that I am only criticising. The translator was obviously translating from a phonetic notation and she obviously understood the Silesian. Which is, on the one hand, perfectly excusable, but it is much less excusable that she did not find these Silesian pirates a little suspicious. It would have been enough for her to type Spartacus pirates into a search engine and she would have immediately found out that they were pirates from Cilicia, and then she would have typed Cilicia into the same search engine and found out where it was. All in all, about 10 minutes of work and one less mistake. (Nikolai)",Opinion/Argumentation

"""Smart working villages"" are now a new trend in Italy. And local authorities are trying to take advantage of the opportunities offered by internet access, which makes teleworking possible for anyone who only needs a computer. <p/> During the pandemic, teleworking has taken off, which means that many people work from home, on weekends or even somewhere on the coast on the other side of the world. Two Italian cities are even offering to pay anyone willing to move in and continue working remotely from a new address, CNN reports. <p/> The municipal authorities in Santi Fiori in Tuscany and Rieti in Lazio are willing to cover half the rent for anyone willing to move to the two cities for a long period of time to work remotely. Rents are already quite low, which makes the offer all the more tempting. But like any other, this one is not without requirements: anyone planning to move here must have a regular job. <p/> Italy - compared to other European countries - has been hit hard by the new coronavirus and the economic and tourism recovery will take several years. But with teleworking, Italians have also started to move to areas and cities that were previously facing out-migration. Smaller, almost deserted towns are now full of life. Italy has thus killed two birds with one stone - as well as revitalising certain areas, there are now fewer people in the larger cities, so the spread of the virus is slowing down, reports CNN. <p/> Santi Fiori, a town near the wine paradise of Val D'Orcia and Siena, is currently home to just 2 500 people. Mayor Federico Balocchi believes that modern technology and teleworking offer the possibility of revitalising his hometown. Rents in Santa Fiora currently range between 300 and 500 euros per month, and the municipality is willing to cover up to 200 euros of rent. This means that prospective tenants could live in the town for two to six months for as little as €100 a month. <p/> There is a choice of apartments in stone houses in the town centre and comfortable villas on the outskirts. The local authorities invite interested parties to visit their website to see all the properties currently available. The town has recently developed a good internet connection and several points where the World Wide Web can be accessed free of charge.

"Yogi Bhajan <p/> Born on August 26, 1929 in the small village of Kot Harkarn in what was then India as Harbhajan Singh. At the incredibly young age of 16, he was appointed as a Kundalini Yoga Master by his teacher Sant Hazara Singh. He was also trained in Hatha Yoga under Acharya Narinder Dev at Yoga Smriti, and at Sivananda Ashram in Rishikesh, he was inspired by the Infinite Truthfulness of Vedanta philosophy. He also completed his formal studies in psychology and worked as a government official. In 1968, invited to teach yoga in the West, he travelled to Canada and from there to Los Angeles, where he began to impart the knowledge and wisdom of kundalini yoga to the young masses yearning for self-realisation and free expression. In 1971 he became a master of White Tantra (Mahan Tantric), which releases a lot of unconscious negativity through guided meditations. In 1970 he became the main religious and administrative authority of the Sikh Dharma in the West.

"On Tuesday, 18.10. , we were visited at the Department of Biology by national and foreign (European Commission) monitors of Life+ projects. The whole SloWolf team gathered and presented the activities and products carried out, and the financial part of the project was also scrutinised. <p/> Visit of the external Life+ monitors from Slovenia and the monitors from the European Commission (photo U.M.) <p/> The monitors also had a closer look at the equipment for collecting non-invasive wolf samples during winter tracking, which is distributed annually among hunters and other volunteers during field work. (photo: U.M.) <p/> In a series of five facilitated workshops held in January and February 2011, we invited representatives of governmental and non-governmental institutions representing stakeholders related to wolf conservation in Slovenia to draft a proposal for the Action Plan for Wolf Management in Slovenia. More information about the workshops can be found here. <p/> The hunting season for wolves started in October, following a decision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. As it takes an enormous amount of work to catch a live wolf, both by researchers and by the hunters who help us (on average over 100 field days for one successful catch), every, otherwise legal, kill of a collared wolf would negate a lot of the effort put in, and would also deprive everyone of the interesting and valuable information that collars provide. <p/> In good light conditions, which allow a reliable shot, the collars are visible - the band is light green (Vojko), brown (Slavc) or light blue (Luka), and all the battery cases are white. The list of hunting families in whose hunting grounds the three wolves equipped so far this year are as follows: LD Bukovje, LD Col, LD Črna jama, LD Divača, LD Dolenja vas, LD Draga, LD Gradišče Košana, LD Hrenovice, LD Javornik Postojna, LD Kozina, LD Kras Dutovlje, LD Loški Potok, LD Materija, LD Nanos, LD Obrov, LD Pivka, LD Planina, LD Podgorje, LD Prestranek, LD Raša Štorje, LD Ribnica, LD Rižana, LD Senožeče, LD Sodražica, LD Tabor Sežana, LD Vojkovo, LD Vreme and LD Vrhe Vrabče (see also maps of wolf movements to date). In addition, members of neighbouring LDs should also pay special attention, as we expect the movement areas of both packs to increase slightly during the winter. The young wolf Luka could also have left his natal pack by this time and headed to another area. <p/> Regular wolf culling has started. Watch out for wolves with collars! <p/> On Friday, 6.5.2011, a wolf was caught near Slavnik in Primorska and fitted with a GPS-GSM telemetry collar. The male wolf weighed 39.5 kg and was about 7 years old. He was named Vojko. He tolerated the training well and retreated to the nearby forests shortly after his release. The results of the biometric measurements are available on the wolf ID card page. <p/> The wolf was caught on the edge of the territory of the ""Slavnik"" pack. A wolf named Brin was also hunted nearby and collared in April 2010, but was subsequently killed half a year later. Genetic analyses and data from the telemetry collar will be sent in the coming days to determine the social status of the wolf Vojko. <p/> TV Slovenia's Education Programme has produced a documentary on wolves in Slovenia entitled ""Wolf"" as part of the series ""Biotopes"". The film also presents the activities taking place within the SloWolf project. TV Slovenia broadcast the film on 30 April 2011 and you can watch it online at this link: <p/> We have prepared an analysis of the effectiveness of wolf culling in reducing damage to domestic animals. In addition to the analysis of the impact of wolf culling on the level of damage in Slovenia, the report also reviews the results of foreign research on the effectiveness of wolf culling in Europe and North America. The report also includes management recommendations on the implementation of wolf culling and the prevention of damage to domestic animals. <p/> Participants in the workshop included representatives of governmental and non-governmental institutions (Faculty of Biotechnology (experts in agronomy, forestry, biology and zootechnics), Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food, Nature Conservation Institute, Environment Agency of the Republic of Slovenia, Forest Institute, Dinaricum Association, Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry, Association for Animal Liberation and Animal Rights, Federation of Small Animal Breeders' Associations, Special Purpose Hunting Grounds and the Kolpa Landscape Park), representing interest groups related to wolf conservation in Slovenia. The main purpose of the workshops is to first define, through a participatory approach involving all stakeholders, the threats and challenges to wolf management in Slovenia and coexistence with people. In the following workshops, we will try to find the most effective solutions that will allow both the long-term existence of wolves and the reduction of conflicts and improve coexistence between wolves and people. <p/> In our management planning we will also follow the Guidelines for the Transboundary Management of Large Carnivore Populations in Europe, as wolves in Slovenia are only part of the larger Dinaric-Balkan population and are constantly crossing borders with neighbouring countries, especially Croatia. The first workshop was therefore also attended by representatives of the Croatian Institute for Nature Conservation, the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia and the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb. <p/> Representatives from the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, the Hunting Association of Slovenia, local associations of small stock breeders and associations against animal torture are also expected at the next two workshops on Thursday and Friday (3 and 4 February 2011). <p/> In the January issue of the magazine ""Lovec"" we published an article on the life of the wolf Tina, in which we summarise the 4-year follow-up of the wolf, which was fitted with a telemetry collar in 2007 after she accidentally got caught in a lynx trap. The article is available here: <p/> In order to present the public with as objective a picture as possible and to allow for a more constructive debate, the following link presents the position of the SloWolf project team on the culling of wolves in Slovenia: <p/> Over the course of the four-year project, we will be publishing four issues of a project newsletter, which we have named Wolf Herring. The main purpose of the newsletter is to keep you regularly informed about the results and planned activities of our ""wolf"" project. The content will follow the red thread of the project, which is to ensure the long-term conservation of the wolf population, its prey and habitats, and the coexistence of humans and wolves in Slovenia, in an interesting way. We have printed 700 copies, which we will distribute to libraries and other centres in the wolf range to reach as many readers as possible from the local population in the area.The electronic version of the newsletter can be found here. <p/> Training of ZGS officers for damage assessment of protected species at the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb <p/> Within the Life + SloWolf project, the Forest Institute (ZGS), Department of Forest Animals and Hunting, organised a training of ZGS officers for damage assessment of protected species, this time with a focus on large carnivores. <p/> The training was held at the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb (VF in ZG), both due to the unpreparedness of the Veterinary Faculty in Ljubljana to organise such training, and due to the experience of Croatian colleagues who regularly organise such training for their delegates. Due to the large number of delegates and the limited space in the secirnice of the Faculty in Zagreb, the training took place in two groups on 2 and 3 November 2010. The attendance was very good as practically all delegates assessing damage from large carnivores in the ZGS organisational units attended. We were also joined by the Director of ZGS Mr. Jošt Jakša, the Head of the Department for Forest Animals and Hunting of ZGS Mr. Marko Jonozovič, the Senior Adviser at the Department for Forest Animals and Hunting of ZGS Mr. Miha Marenče and the Head of the LPN Service of ZGS Mr. mag. Janko Mehle and some colleagues from the Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Ljubljana. <p/> The participants of the educational workshop were welcomed at the beginning by the Dean of the Faculty of Biology in Zagreb, and then we went through the comprehensive lectures of Mr. Tomaž Skrbinšek (Department of Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Ljubljana), Assoc. Prof. Dr. Josip Kusak, Dr. Andrea Gudan Kurilj and Dr. Janis Kusak. Dr. Ana Beck (all from the Faculty of Science, Zagreb), upgraded their knowledge in the field of recognition of signs of killing and consumption of prey of large carnivores, premortem and postmortem changes on carcasses, and potentially dangerous diseases that can be transmitted by carcasses of killed animals. Mr Skrbinšek briefed the delegates on the procedures of saliva collection from carcasses of killed animals for DNA identification of wolves, which will start in 2011 in the framework of the SloWolf project. The first part of the training was in the form of lectures, and after lunch we went to the Faculty's dissection room. There, we consolidated the knowledge we had acquired through concrete cases, where we together examined several carcasses of sheep killed by wolves. <p/> Practical part of the training of the ZGS Damage Assessment Officers at the Veterinary Faculty in Zagreb with the lecturer Assoc. Prof. Dr. Josip Kusak. (Photo: Rok Černe) <p/> In the early morning hours of 20 October 2010, a wolf ""Brin"", equipped with a GPS telemetry collar, was shot in a pasture in the vicinity of the settlement of Petrinje in the Kozina LD. <p/> The male was caught on 13.4.2010 in the area of Slavnik. During the telemetric monitoring, his pack was moving in the area from the Glinščice Valley near the border with Italy to Čičaria and Učka above Opatija in Croatia. <p/> Juniper was stalked in a pasture when five wolves attacked sheep. The collar was not seen by the captor in low light conditions. The male weighed 40 kg and was in good condition. He was shot as part of a regular wolf cull (12 wolves are scheduled to be cull in Slovenia between the beginning of October 2010 and the end of February 2011). Genetic analyses will be carried out in the coming days to determine whether Brin had the status of the alpha male of the pack. <p/> As part of Action A.4 - Assessment of wolf damage in agriculture, we have produced maps of wolf damage between 2003-2005, between 2007-2009, a map of the potential wolf range in Slovenia in the event of a spatial expansion of the wolf population, and a map showing the areas where wolf attacks on small livestock can be expected, given the current distribution of sheep. The maps are included in the final report of the campaign, which included a review and analysis of wolf damage in Slovenia. The report also includes management recommendations for reducing wolf damage.",News

"Washington Post: Snowden reportedly caused less harm than initial estimates <p/> National Intelligence Director James Clapper has assessed that former National Security Agency (NSA) contract analyst Edward Snowden has caused less harm to US intelligence officials than initially estimated, according to the Washington Post. <p/> ""We are still assessing the damage, but it seems that he did not take away as much material as we first thought. There were a lot of things he could only look at, but he couldn't get them off the system,"" Clapper estimated on Thursday, speaking to the newspaper. He added that the damage was still extensive. <p/> US intelligence officials initially feared that Snowden had leaked data on the armed forces' command and control communications network. This was not to be the case. <p/> Since last year, Snowden has been making public embarrassing facts about the workings of US intelligence, from mass surveillance of Americans to eavesdropping on allied leaders and even economic espionage. <p/> All these publications have so far caused little embarrassment at the top of President Barack Obama's administration, but the essential damage is that the US is exposed as no better than, for example, China, which is regularly accused of hacking and spying. <p/> The US administration is not afraid of embarrassment, because it has already gone through this with the WikiLeaks releases. Intelligence officials are more concerned about whether Snowden might have taken something that could give other countries useful information about the workings of the military and spies. <p/> Clapper's assessment is probably very premature. The world's media have so far published only about 300 documents, Snowden is believed to have another 1.5 million in his possession, and his journalist friend Glenn Greenwald, through whom the documents are going to the media, promises that the saga will not be over so soon. <p/> There are therefore more than too many documents to continue negotiating Snowden's repatriation from Russia in a way that does not immediately put him behind bars. But the intelligence community and the government will first have to swallow their anger and resentment, and they are not yet ready to do so.

"Closing ceremony of the Fabula Festival <p/> To close the successful Fabula Festival, which this year was crowned by the visit of Scottish literary star Irvin Welsh and his performance in front of a packed CD Club, the organisers invited three Slovenian authors and one female author to speak (and read). Stanka Hrastelj, Milan Kleč, Marko Sosič and Dušan Šarotar talked about myths, their influence on our everyday lives, their importance for literature and our (un)conscious involvement in mythical worlds. On this occasion, a collection of short fiction Myths of Our Everyday Life was published with one story from each of the invited authors. <p/> It is not entirely clear why these four authors were invited to participate. Were the organisers guided in their selection by the intrinsic and substantive merits of the selected writings, or was it more than a random selection? Given the diversity of the four stories collected, which sometimes have almost nothing in common with myths or are simply a negation of them (Stanka Hrastelj), the second option seems more likely. Nevertheless, at least for Dušan Šarotar and Mark Sosič, judging by their reflective answers, the subject of myths is not alien to them and served as a good starting point for the emerging story. <p/> Dušan Šarotar pointed out that interpreting myths is something he does all the time, because myths are nothing but memory, and we are all made of memories. Myths, he said, also connect people in time and space, define a community through time and give it meaning and solidity. Marko Sosič agreed that in the field of the unconscious as well as the conscious, we are entwined in Slovenian folk traditions and ancient myths. However, he stressed that we need to develop a critical attitude towards the mythical images of Western society that serve as models and ideals. In order to face the present time and ourselves, Sosič said, we must acquire the distance necessary for critical reflection. <p/> Stanka Hrastelj focused on the female characters that define the Slovenian mythological field. She reflected on two in particular: the beautiful Vida, who seems to be the obvious choice, and the figure of the Cankarjan mother - a suffering mother and wife who sacrifices herself for a man and expects his eternal gratitude in return. This figure - as the author has rightly observed - is still very much present in our society. In writing the short story, however, Hrasteljeva did lean on the character of the beautiful Vida, but added a twist in the form of a happy ending. The author also pointed out that myths serve as a mirror to explain our behaviour, because they are rooted in the behaviour of humanity. <p/> Milan Kleč did not say much. During Šarotar and Sosič's debate, he provided a comic interlude with a story about a skylark that had wandered onto his balcony and was persistently making noises there, disturbing his (peace of mind), as such a squawking was supposedly a harbinger of death. The tale of a heroic confrontation with a winged peace-builder in a residential neighbourhood and its subsequent removal - combined with Kleč's tormented appearance, as he acted as if he would rather be anywhere else than on the stage of the CD Club at that moment - gave the hundred or so visitors to the evening a good laugh. Tina Kozin, who asked the same questions to all the guests, did not let herself be confused and, when it was Kleč's turn to answer again, she cleverly adapted the question to the author's narration (and situation). <p/> At the end, each of the invitees read an excerpt from his short story, with the exception of Milan Kleč, who decided to read a poem by the recently deceased Matjaž Kocbek instead of his own story. Marko Sosič chose the legend of the Lady of Devin as the basis for his story ""Contempt"" and set it in the currently very topical theme of unemployment and the resulting feeling of shame Milan Kleč's story ""Krakow"" describes the fulfilled wish of a poor student and waitress who pays her way to this Polish city and a supernatural exchange, which happens at the end of the story Dušan Šarotar, in the story ""Among the High Clouds That Will Sing"", set the action in Sobota and framed it with the fascination with the stars and the many folk beliefs about the stars that are still present today Stanka Hrastelj - as mentioned above - told a modern story about the beautiful Vida with a happy ending. <p/>Myths are an extremely broad and rewarding subject, and there is, of course, much more that could be said about them. As Marko Sosič pointed out, myths are born out of man's attempt to understand the world, but despite the remarkable scientific advances of recent centuries, man remains essentially the same, as does his need for stories to make sense of the world. <p/> The Fabula Festival 2013, which celebrated its tenth anniversary, has come to a close. It is a pity that the tradition of awarding the Dnevnik Fabula, Slovenia's only literary prize for the best original short fiction collection, has come to an end this year.

"In shopping centres, preferably with separate entrances and exits and with floor signage <p/> Ahead of Monday's opening of shopping centres and activities in them, the NICE has made recommendations for both retailers and shoppers. Measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus will make shopping in large centres a little different from what shoppers were used to before the crisis. Among other things, the NIJZ advises separate entrances and exits and floor signage. <p/> In addition to the standard and general recommendations that apply across the board, such as frequent hand washing and disinfection, cough hygiene, appropriate distances and the like, the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) has made additional detailed recommendations ahead of Monday's resumption of activity in shopping centres. These apply not only to shops but also to the many other service providers and activities (repairs, repair services, book and paper shops, watchmakers, jewellers, key-making, etc.) located in these centres. The NIJH recommends that the maximum number of customers in a room should be adapted to the size of the room, taking into account a sufficient personal distance of at least 1.5 metres. In the common corridors of the shopping centre, it is necessary to prevent large numbers of people from loitering, and it is therefore advisable to use floor markings and guide posts with tapes to indicate the direction of movement, so that people do not move in the opposite direction at the same time. Care will also need to be taken to ensure that the stalls and other services available in the common corridors are properly positioned. Where possible, shopping centres should also provide for entry and exit through separate entrances and exits. The implementation of these measures should be supervised by security guards or authorised employees of the shopping centres. Retailers should also ensure that employees and customers are able to wash and disinfect their hands in the business premises, including by means of appropriate disinfectant dispensers. In addition to posters and infographics, warnings should also be given in shopping centres through regular audio messages or digital displays. Common seating and rest areas such as benches, massage chairs and seating in corridors will not be used, nor will common children's play areas. The NIJH also reminded people to ensure effective ventilation, especially with windows wide open, and to avoid air circulation with mechanical ventilation. Shoppers will also need to follow the recommendations before entering and staying in shopping centres: only healthy individuals without signs of respiratory infection should enter, while the elderly and patients with chronic non-communicable diseases at higher risk are advised to take extra protection or consider visiting the shopping centre as a matter of urgency. Hand disinfection before entering and repeatedly while in the building will be mandatory, especially when shopping in different stores, using escalators or lifts (stairs are preferable). They also advise minimising touching of any surfaces and objects, including displays, and going contactless when making payments.",News
"The top 10 family-friendly holidays in Europe <p/> Little wanderers are missing something <p/> Do you agree with Tripadvisor's ranking? Little Tramps would add to it: <p/> Tuscany (Italy) <p/> Sicily (Italy) <p/> Valencia (Spain) <p/> Wondering why? Because the walk around the capital is beautiful and the view from the top is uuuuaaaaaauuuuu. Because the little wanderers have a lot to run, skip, climb up the narrow stairs, look through the lino, imagine how they used to defend themselves from here. Because the collection of weapons just fascinates them. Because they would listen and listen to the mixing of Russian and Italian. Because they themselves have small cars and interesting number plates. Because you will be wandering around with your loved ones. Because there are so many more reasons that you have to discover for yourself and make your own memories. And because San Marino is relatively close, just 510 km from Ljubljana, which is less than 5 hours' drive. It's also close to the Adriatic Sea, with its kilometres of coastline and many tourist towns that invite us to soak up the sun, jump in the sea and enjoy a homemade ice cream. So don't just make it a day trip, make it a multi-day holiday. <p/> Some people say they are in love with Tuscany. Picturesque hills and valleys with vineyards, olive trees and sunflowers. Its proximity makes it even more interesting for Slovenians, as we can go there practically at any time. 4-5 hours and we are there. <p/> There are 6 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Tuscany: the historic centre of Florence, the historic centre of Siena, the square of Pisa Cathedral, the historic centre of San Gimignano, the historic centre of Pienza and Val d'Orcia. <p/> Venice has always been known as the city of a hundred canals and bridges. In the city, the visitor will not find a single road or vehicle as we are used to on the mainland. From the beginning, the rich merchants and nobles of Venice have been transported by gondolas. Today, the gondola is renowned as the most romantic means of transport. Children will also find the boats in Venice most interesting. <p/> If you're up for exploring the big city, then you can certainly take your child to London. The city offers many attractions that are also interesting for children. If flying there on low-cost carriers is very cheap, you will pay a bit more for accommodation (cheap accommodation can be found here too, if you are not demanding), but above all for entrance fees, which are certainly not cheap.",Promotion

"Interview published in the professional magazine Isis, the newsletter of the Medical Chamber of Slovenia, January 2008 (27) <p/> On the occasion of the two-thousandth issue of the ZIB Bulletin <p/> Interview with Anka Štrukelj Fras, Editor <p/> Question. What is your experience? <p/> Answer. We can still write down what we did at the beginning when we invited readers to subscribe: the ZIB Bulletin is a daily online publication for healthcare needs. It is original, up-to-date, transparent, concise and independent. The motto of the ZIB Bulletin is Saving Time. It has been our experience that ZIB, as a miniature electronic publication consisting of short articles and lists of relevant documents and media releases, without images and enticing graphic supplements, has gained weight over the years. The more the pages of the World Wide Web are literally whittled down by these additions. In the face of the latter, content often becomes secondary or, even if it is good, awaits the reader locked behind a magic web door that takes time and money to open. Our readers, in particular, do not have time to spare. They include almost all the managers of Slovenian national, regional and local health institutions - hospitals, health centres, pharmacies, health care institutions and companies. They receive the daily ZIB in the form of an e-mail at night and usually read it in the morning. Or as Igor Vuk, Director of the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia's regional unit in Novogoriz, told us on the occasion of the 1000th issue: 'For some people, drinking coffee is their first and favourite morning task. For me, it's checking out your condensed health care and health insurance news."" An encouraging greeting and we wish it still applies. <p/> Question. <p/> Answer. For example, for the 1000th issue, we rewarded readers with a slightly redesigned page and made it possible to read the content in a single column, which makes it easier to read the bulletin on the screen. We then started to offer a Little ZIB in the mornings with a selection of media articles, which brings together selected media stories of the day and is a ""preview"" of the Media section of the forthcoming Bulletin, which will be published the following day. Ahead of the 2,000th issue, we have given readers direct access to public procurement documents and the Official Journal. And there will be more in the future. <p/> Question: Healthcare is often surrounded by affairs, which the media construct in different ways, from objective reporting to the presentation of less and more spicy facts or even interest-biased supplements. How do you bring the reporting of these affairs into the otherwise calm and sometimes even a little dignified ZIB? <p/> Answer. The editor is too much of a journalist to manage such a thing. It is made up of facts, respect and knowledge of the field of health and the people involved in it in a variety of ways. These three things - facts, the field and the people - are interwoven in complex patterns that are not always invented by individual people, but ripple through the times in which they are created. <p/> To put this into words, the ZIB editorial team consistently avoids using pejorative words and phrases in published articles. Very often, it is with bad language that affairs are glossed over in the media. They invite exotic reading as exotic exotica, obscuring or even distorting the essence of the actual phenomenon or event. And when you shake off the ""leaves"", what remains is what it is. Facts are not always pretty, and the problems we report on are not, as a rule, pretty. But if they are presented as they are, they are more likely to be solved or eliminated by those to whom they refer. <p/> Question: A particularly topical issue in healthcare at the moment - and one that ZIB has written about on several occasions - is that of information related to medicines, where there is a necessary, but not easily identifiable, boundary between information and advertising. Is it even definable? <p/> Answer: There is no precise boundary. There is good information in good advertising and there is bad information in bad advertising. The inner self can judge what is important, even in this respect. At Zib, we help ourselves by consistently citing the sources of information for each article. <p/> Question. <p/> Answer. Well, we have also made a little Zib advertising duck, with a yellow beak, inviting people to read information about what ZIB offers and who it is for. The printed Health Calendar also bears our logo. That's all there is to it in terms of publicity. As the Health Calendar is constantly expanding, the latest version is kept up-to-date in the Materials on the subscription page. For the two-thousandth issue, the Health Calendar has gone to the open page as a gift to potential subscribers and readers. <p/> Question. Just like, for example, in a TV diary there is a whole world day. How do you fit this increasingly loud and multi-sensory event into a few pages? <p/> Answer. This is the simple secret of Zib's Time Saving motto. <p/> Question. <p/> Answer: They are not raining. They come in drops, but they do not dry up.",Interview

"Posts tagged 'incinerator' <p/> In the autumn 2010 issue of Dupličan, Bogdan Pogačar published the following article, which we reproduce in full: <p/> A directive of the European Union required Member States to issue new permits, or to re-examine and, if necessary, renew existing permits, for all industrial installations that started operating before 30 October 1999 by 30 October 2007. <p/> Slovenia is one of only six countries not to comply with the EU's Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, and will have to defend itself before the European Court of Justice. It faces a fine of €80 million, which the country will have to pay over the next four years. Given that the inhabitants of the southern part of the municipality of Kamnik (Perovo, Bakovnik, Šmarca, Volčji Potok, Duplica) regularly have legitimate concerns about the quality of the air they breathe, which is part of their everyday lives, such indifference on the part of the State is incomprehensible to me. The fact is that we live in a densely populated area and in close proximity to industrial plants that pollute the air with emissions from their activities. Of course, these are companies that have been operating here for many years and cannot be relocated elsewhere, but everything must be done to reduce emissions into the air. It is not just about the health of the most vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly, but also about reducing the value of movable and immovable property in the area. <p/> The most painful thorn in our side is the 'environmentally unfriendly' operation of the Tisa Ltd. wood biomass heating plant, which has been preventing us from enjoying a good quality of life for 13 years.",Opinion/Argumentation
"Movember: Cancer facts and misconceptions <p/> To raise awareness about men's health, Playboy Hall of Fame hockey players asked passers-by, acquaintances and friends what they knew about cancer. They chose 10 interesting statements and asked an expert in oncology, MSc. Mirjana Rajer, MD, PhD, who explained and justified whether the claims were fact or fallacy. <p/> 1. Cancer treatment is more stressful than the disease itself. <p/> Fallacy. Of course, treatment has its co-morbidities, but it cannot be said that treatment is more exhausting than the disease itself. The argument comes from history, when so-called 'supportive care' was not so developed and, for example, patients who received chemotherapy vomited profusely. Nowadays, we have very effective drugs to prevent this. But it is also true that patients often attribute problems to the treatment that are not really caused by it. It is easier for the patient to find the 'culprit' in the treatment. An example might be a patient who is having radiation to the chest area and has pain in his legs. The patient is more likely to think that the radiation treatment is to blame than, for example, that the vascular problems in the legs are the real cause. Nowadays, treatment is more tailored to the patient than ever before. If a patient is going to undergo a strenuous treatment, we talk to them beforehand, explain why it is necessary and they say whether or not they agree with what is proposed. <p/> 2. Any form of cancer is incurable. <p/> Fallacy. Many cancers are nowadays completely curable. Especially if the disease is detected at an early stage and treated as soon as possible. Rather, we can say that all cancers are curable if they are detected early enough. More than half of all cancer patients are completely cured. Of course, we can also say that the glass is half empty and say that we do not cure half of them, but the results of treatment are getting better every year, and we are all working very hard to do that. <p/> 3. People who get cancer can only lie in bed and be passive. <p/> Fallacy. Patients are physically active to the best of their ability. Many people with cancer continue to lead an active life, which includes both daily chores and sport. Many patients keep in excellent shape, go hiking, dancing ... Cancer does not mean that a patient can just lie in bed. Patients are even encouraged to be active. However, we notice that it is often the relatives who restrict the patient, saying that he or she is not allowed to work in the garden, go out of the house or similar. The important thing is to talk to the doctor, which is usually the time when we resolve any dilemmas about the patient's activity. <p/> 4. Cancer is only curable if you are lucky. <p/> Fallacy. Many cancers are - especially if detected in time - completely curable. Prevention and early detection are key. People are not sufficiently aware of the importance of screening programmes such as SVIT (for bowel cancer), ZORA (cervical cancer) and DORA (breast cancer). The aim of these programmes is to detect cancer at an early stage, when it is still curable. I often hear that people have received an invitation to take part in SVIT and have thrown the invitation in the rubbish. But when they hear that someone has been diagnosed with cancer and cured through this programme, they dig through the rubbish to see if the invitation is still there, and they go and take part in the programme. <p/> 5. If there is no family history of cancer, then I am not interested in cancer. <p/> Fallacy. Heredity is only one factor and contributes to a small number of cancers. Most cancers are caused by other things, such as environmental damage, smoking, etc... So it is a mistake to think that if no one in the family has had cancer, we will not get it either. <p/> 6. Lung cancer is caused by smoking alone. <p/> Fallacy. Smoking is an important factor, but there are other factors: I am pointing out heredity, the polluted working environment, radon in buildings ... 15-20% of lung cancer patients have never smoked. However, smoking is a risk factor that can be prevented, so raising awareness of the harmful effects of smoking is very important. <p/> 7. Chemotherapy is harmful to the body and is only in the interest of pharmaceutical companies. <p/> False. Chemotherapy is one of the established options for cancer treatment. But of course, every drug has side effects. It is an exaggeration to claim that chemotherapy is only in the interests of pharmaceutical companies. Ask a person who is healthy as a result of chemotherapy. <p/> Fact. It is true that the earlier cancer is detected, the better the chances of cure. At this point, I would like to stress once again the importance of screening programmes. People should take part in them in greater numbers than they do now. <p/> Fallacy. We starve ourselves before we starve cancer. Most cancer patients who are treated for cancer develop metabolic changes that lead to a metabolic stress state. Stress metabolism is also characterised by processes in which glucose is formed from the body's protein and fat stores. Insufficient food intake or starvation further accelerates glucose production. In this way, the body's deterioration in the face of cancer is further accelerated. This does not kill the cancer cells, as they are able to obtain sufficient energy and individual nutrients one way or another. <p/> On the contrary, we have a lot of scientific evidence that weight loss contributes to poorer cancer treatment outcomes. Therefore, adequate nutritional support of the cancer patient is part of the cancer treatment according to modern medical recommendations. <p/> You can also find out more about cancer itself and prevention at free lectures organised by Playboy Hall of Fame players as part of the MoGame event. Cancer, the disease of a hundred faces. The lecture will be given by oncologist Mag. Mirjana Rajer, oncologist, and Marija Vegelj Pirc, psychooncologist, and former football player Jaka Jakopič will share his personal experience of cancer.",Opinion/Argumentation

"Miscellaneous <p/> This year, for the 30th time, the Swiss compared all types of new cars on the basis of criteria set out years ago by the Heidelberg Institute for the Environment (IFEU). For the first time, hybrid cars lost first place to natural gas cars. <p/> Three eco-cars, the VW eco-up, the Skoda Citigo and the Seat Mii, took first place <p/> How the table is made The comparisons are always based on the latest scientific findings and the state of the art. Over the last ten years, new findings have continuously influenced the scoring, as the environmental impact of individual emissions has always been reconsidered. CO2 emissions, emissions of fine particulate matter, the burden on humans and the natural environment have become more important in the scoring. CO2 was found to be the main greenhouse gas, and vehicles account for one third of all emissions, which is why its share is so high. Interestingly, there are no electric cars on the list, as the assessors did not obtain reliable data on their characteristics. <p/> The table below shows all the passenger cars, from small to large, that scored the highest in the evaluation. <p/> Noise, toxins and nature In Switzerland, two thirds of people feel overwhelmed by noise, mainly from traffic. The constant noise environment causes stress and ill health, and is also bad for heart patients and cancer sufferers. Measurements have shown that the impact of the noisiest car is as disturbing to people as if ten cars with the lowest noise levels drove past at the same time. The most toxic substances are emitted by a vehicle on a cold start and depend on the type of fuel. They also point out that modern petrol injection engines emit extremely high levels of soot. They measure the impact on nature in terms of NOx emissions. Together with sulphur dioxide, they cause acidification of the soil, overfertilisation of soils and rivers, and are involved in the formation of harmful ozone peaks in summer. <p/> Impact prioritisation in the assessment <p/> Model selection Only vehicles emitting no more than 150 g of CO2 per kilometre, equivalent to 6.5 litres of fuel per 100 km, can be included in the assessment list. The exception is large cars with more than 5 seats, which can reach up to 180 g/km. Not all variants of one model have been considered in the comparison, as the list would be too long, so the more environmentally friendly variants have always been chosen. Niche models or vehicles from manufacturers with a negligible market share were also not considered. <p/> What the measurements showed Last year, the Lexus CT 200h Hybrid, a lower-mid-range vehicle, came first. This year, it was pushed into fourth place by three equivalent vehicles powered by a mix of natural gas and biogas, which is found at all gas stations in Switzerland. The first-placed VW eco up! also scores highly in terms of occupant safety, with the best result in the crash tests. The lack of occupant protection is therefore no longer an excuse to buy a car that is too big for its number. The new Toyota Yaris is out of the top ten due to excessive noise, even though it has an extremely low CO2 emission of only 79 grams per kilometre. <p/> The development of electric cars is moving very slowly. New models appear only sporadically, as customers do not show the necessary enthusiasm. Manufacturers also do not provide scientifically based data that can be used for evaluation. In addition, they find that the factory consumption data is not true and drivers should only charge their electric vehicles with green electricity to make them environmentally attractive, according to the evaluators.",Promotion

"Šarec happy with proposal for EU top jobs <p/> Prime Minister Marjan Šarec, arriving at an extraordinary EU summit, said the proposal circulating on the distribution of top jobs was not bad. <p/> Reuters <p/> Marjan Šarec says the proposal he has seen is not bad. <p/> The scenario circulating unofficially is that socialist Frans Timmermans would become president of the European Commission. ""He is certainly a good candidate,"" Marjan Šarec said when asked whether the Dutchman was acceptable to Slovenia. <p/> ""We have now seen a proposal. For me it is not a bad proposal. Even if that were the case, it is a pretty good proposal,"" the prime minister said. But when asked more specific questions, he replied only that it was difficult to describe the details when arriving at the summit. <p/> The proposal was agreed in Osaka, on the sidelines of the G20 summit <p/> An unofficial scenario is circulating that the post of President of the European Commission would go to the Socialists, the post of President of the European Parliament and the high-level foreign policy post to the centre-right European People's Party (EPP), and the post of President of the European Council to the Liberals. <p/> ""They say they have agreed something in Japan. Now, when we sit down, we will see how it goes, and then we will move on. It is difficult for me to say much right now, I can only express the hope that there will be an agreement today or overnight so that the process can move forward and there will not be too long a deadlock,"" Šarec said of the proposal in play. <p/> The Liberals getting the post of President of the European Council seems good to the Slovenian Prime Minister. He did not want to talk about the names, saying that they must first sit down at the table. He also refused to comment on who his favourite or favourite candidate was and whether the Danish Liberal Margrethe Vestager, whom he has so far supported for the Commission presidency, was still in the running. <p/> ""Now we need to hear proposals. I cannot say anything until I am inside and until I see if anything new has happened in the meantime. It's been an hour and a half, something may have changed in that time,"" he said. <p/> Šarec hopes that there will be no blockages, recalling that decision-making does not require pure consensus and that even five years ago not everyone supported the then candidate Jean-Claude Juncker. He feels that it would be good to reach a compromise to some extent, but if this is not possible, then it must be decided by a majority. <On the wisdom of isolating the Visegrad Quartet, which is opposed to Timmermans, he said: ""There is a need for compromise. If there is a majority for an option, the majority will not accommodate some. You know, sometimes on a trip, the bus has to close the door and move on if you are waiting for someone. But I do not want to prejudge. That is speculation. I hope that we will reach a compromise and unanimously choose someone, because that is a better way forward."" <p/> Asked how long they would sit at the table, he replied that he did not know that either and that if he had his way, they would not sit for long. <p/> Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, arriving at the EU summit, predicted difficult negotiations on leadership positions, in particular on the new President of the European Commission, and warned of an institutional conflict between the European Council and the European Parliament.

"Objectivity in the age of gifts <p/> We all like to receive gifts, and many of us like to give them too. It is only right that a gift should reflect a sincere desire to show appreciation and affection to our neighbour. It is nice if the gift surprises and inspires us with a sense of playfulness, mystery, joy and gratitude. Unfortunately, gift-giving too often degenerates into an alienated, routine and disembodied following of customs. Some gift-givers even see gifts as something that belongs to them, which, when expectations are too high, can lead to ingratitude, disappointment and, eventually, resentment. <p/> A good year ago, the legislator gave us a gift. It made part of the performance-related salary tax-free. But it did so in such a veiled and disguised way that we sometimes wonder whether it was sincere in its intention, because the tax gift announced with fanfare has two flaws that the uninitiated tend to overlook. This is because the payment is not exempt from all taxes, since only income tax is reduced and social contributions are not. And such contributions are not exactly a negligible burden in our country. Moreover, the tax-advantaged payout is not for everyone, but only for those who are successful in business. Business performance is usually determined on the basis of balance sheet data, but this is only finally known in the first quarter of the new financial year. <p/> On the basis of such a muddled solution, some Pharisees can now provoke and blackmail, while the ignorant and deluded demand and resist. A collective performance award is not a gift at the end of the calendar year and must be distinguished from Christmas presents or be properly justified and linked to past performance. <p/> It is right to welcome any gift, including tax gifts. Perhaps the somewhat convoluted tax solution has even awakened in us a forgotten sense of mysterious anticipation. <p/> On behalf of the IKS editorial team, I wish you a peaceful and happy Christmas and a happy and prosperous New Year.",Opinion/Argumentation
"Once upon a time, Councillors Namadeva and Gyanadeva were travelling through the forest. They were thirsty, so they tried to find water. They came across an old, dried-up well. Following the path of wisdom, Gyanadeva turned into a bird, flew inside the well, drank and returned to the surface. Namadeva disagreed with his approach, believing that man should rise to the level of the Divine and not slip down. Therefore he sat and chanted the name of God. The more intensely he chanted it, the more the water level in the well rose, and finally it even overflowed its rim. Without much effort, Namadeva took a drink and felt blissful.

"payment of wage differential - wage compensation - wage compensation for the time spent waiting for placement or employment in another suitable job - disabled person - enjoyment of disability insurance rights acquired under previous legislation - disability compensation - compensation for the time spent waiting - rights under the Social Insurance Act-1 <p/> The plaintiff has acquired the right to compensation for the time spent waiting for placement or employment in another suitable job under the Pension and Disability Insurance Act, and is therefore not entitled to compensation under the Social Insurance Act (ZZPIZ-1)<p/> The plaintiff is entitled to compensation under the Social Insurance Act. <Operative part of the judgment under appeal is partially allowed and the judgment under appeal is amended in point II of the operative part of the judgment (decision on costs) by reducing the amount awarded to EUR 513,00. The remainder of the appeal is dismissed and the judgment under appeal of the Court of First Instance is upheld in part and unchanged. <The parties are ordered to bear their own costs of the appeal. <p/> Reasoning <p/> By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action brought by the applicant seeking an order that the defendant account to her for the gross amount of EUR 3 505,04 in respect of the underpayment of the salary allowance, pay the prescribed taxes and contributions and then pay to her the net sums, together with statutory default interest on the net sums on the gross basis, as set out in paragraph I/1 of the operative part of the judgment. Dismisses the applicant's claim for reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings (paragraph I/2 of the operative part of the judgment) and orders the applicant to reimburse the costs of the proceedings in the sum of EUR 729,96 to the defendant within 15 days (paragraph II of the operative part of the judgment). <p/> The applicant timely appeals against the judgment on all grounds of appeal under Article 338(1) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A., Official Gazette of the RS, No 26/99 et seq.) and requests the Court of Appeal to uphold its appeal and to alter the judgment under appeal by granting the application in full and, in the alternative, to set aside the judgment under appeal and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial and to order the defendant to pay the costs of the appeal. The judgment is based, according to the applicant, on an incorrect and incomplete finding of fact and on an error of substantive law. In the light of the clear statutory provisions, the applicant should have been paid 100 % of the allowance for the time spent waiting for homeworking. The defendant issued the applicant with an order to wait for work at home because it did not have suitable work for her. Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant did not appeal against the decisions of the ZPIZ of 31 March 2003 or the defendant's decision of 25 May 2001, she cannot, in her view, be denied the right to the difference since, during the period at issue, that is to say, from April 2005 to July 2007, the compensation for the time spent waiting for work was governed by the Labour Relations Act (LSA, Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No 42/2002 et seq.). The decision of 31.1.2003 of the ZPIZ did not, by anything in the operative part of the decision, decide that the compensation was 80 %, but only that it was compensation for the time spent waiting for work from 7.7.2001 onwards in the amount of SIT 71 011,61. The 80 % allowance was decided by the defendant by decision of 25.5.2001, against which decision the applicant had no grounds for appeal, since ZDR-02 was not yet in force and, moreover, that decision was not based on the provisions of the Social Insurance Act or the Social Insurance Act, but on Article 34 of the sectoral collective agreement. <p/> The appeal also challenges the decision on costs. The Court of First Instance held five main hearings, at which it took evidence and heard both parties on two occasions, and it was only after that that it decided that the claim was unfounded and could therefore have ordered that each party should bear its own costs. However, if the applicant had to pay any costs to the defendant, the Court of First Instance could have awarded the defendant only one award for the proceedings under No 3012, notwithstanding the fact that the Court of First Instance had reopened the main hearing, and the appellant therefore proposes that the Court of Appeal should make a decision as to the costs of the proceedings in such a way that each party should bear its own costs or that the costs awarded to the defendant should be reduced. <p/> In its response to the appeal, the defendant contested the grounds of appeal as unfounded and requested the Court of Appeal to dismiss the appeal and to order the applicant to pay the defendant's costs of the appeal. <p/> The appeal is partly well founded. <p/> The Court of Appeal examined the judgment under appeal within the limits of the grounds of appeal raised, taking into account, on its own motion, the substantive breaches of the provisions of Article 350(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (C.P.A., Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia, No 26/99 et seq.) 1.points 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 11, with the exception of the existence and correctness of the authorisation to proceed before the court of first instance, and points 12 and 14 of the second paragraph of Article 339 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the correct application of substantive law. In that examination, the Court of First Instance found that the Court of First Instance had not committed any of the substantive infringements of the provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure which the Court of Appeal is required to take into account of its own motion. It also correctly applied the substantive law to the facts correctly and fully established and only the decision on costs was partially erroneous, as will be explained below. <p/> The Court of Appeal fully agrees with the legal and factual grounds of the contested judgment of the Court of First Instance (with the exception of the decision on costs), and therefore does not repeat them and, as regards the grounds of appeal which are of decisive importance pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 360(1) of the ECHR, the Court of First Instance does not rely on them in the present case. <p/> The Court of First Instance correctly found that the applicant was entitled, in view of her ability to work, to a wage allowance for the period of waiting for placement or employment in another suitable job under the provisions of the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (ZPIZ-1, Official Gazette of the Republic of Poland, No. 1, item 360, as amended). No ... of 4 October 2000, in conjunction with the decision of the Pension and Disability Insurance Institute of Slovenia, Regional Unit A. No ... of 27 March 2001, she was classified in category III of disability due to the effects of the disease and with the right to assignment or employment in other suitable work of a physically lighter nature from 29 September 2000 onwards. The applicant was awarded compensation by decision of the Pension and Invalidity Insurance Institute of Slovenia, Regional Unit A., No ... of 31 January 2003, which provided that the employer was to pay the applicant's salary compensation at its own expense. The Employment Relations Act (ZDR, Official Gazette of the RS, No 42/2002) had indeed entered into force before that decision was issued, but the essential point is that the applicant had already acquired the right before that date, and that decision therefore conferred on her the right to wage compensation for the period of her waiting for assignment to another suitable job as from 7.7.2001, on the basis of the provisions of the ZPIZ-1 and the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (ZPIZ, Official Gazette of the RS, Nos 12/92 to 54/98). Pursuant to Article 397 of the ZPIZ-1, beneficiaries of rights on the basis of residual capacity for work established under the regulations applicable until the date laid down in Article 446 of this Law, which is 1 January 2003, shall retain those rights after that date, with the proviso that the cash benefits shall be adjusted as pensions are adjusted. The applicant has always been a category III invalid, but it was only by decision of 26.10.2009 that she was classified as a category I invalid as a result of illness from 9.4.2009 and was granted the right to an invalidity pension from 1.5.2009. The appellant's claims that the Court of First Instance failed to establish the facts in full and erred in the application of the substantive law are therefore unfounded. <p/> The Court of Appeal adds that even an appeal by the applicant against the decision of the ZPIZ of 31 March 2003 would not alter the fact that the applicant has acquired the right to a benefit under the rules on pension and invalidity insurance and is therefore not entitled to a benefit under the ZDR. The appellant's submissions that the amount of the applicant's allowance was fixed by the defendant by decision of 25 May 2001 are also unfounded, since the amount of the allowance was fixed by a decision of the ZPIZ of 31 January 2003 in the amount of SIT 71 011,61 per month. In accordance with Article 137 of the ZPIZ, in conjunction with Article 48 of the ZPIZ-1, the minimum pension base was taken as the basis on which the salary allowance for the period of waiting for employment or assignment to other suitable work was calculated, at a rate of 80 %, and the allowance thus calculated was adjusted in the same way as the pensions and amounted to SIT 71 011,61 as from 7.7.2001. <p/> On the basis of the foregoing, the Court of First Instance correctly rejected the applicant's claim for payment of the difference between the amount of compensation received for the period of waiting for work, which was 80 % of the basic amount, and 100 % of the amount of compensation under Article 137 of the Labour Code. <p/> The appellant, however, submits that the Court of First Instance erred in its assessment of the defendant's necessary legal costs, which the appellant is liable to reimburse. Notwithstanding the fact that the Court of First Instance reopened the main hearing, the defendant is entitled, pursuant to Tariff No 3012 of the Law on the Tariff of Lawyers (Law on the Tariff of Lawyers, Official Gazette of the RS 67/2008), to only one hearing fee, and the Court of Appeal therefore reduced the amount of the costs awarded to EUR 513,00, namely one hearing fee of EUR 190,80 and VAT of 20 % on that amount. However, the Court of First Instance had no basis for deciding, as the appeal suggests, that each party should bear its own costs, since the applicant was unsuccessful in the proceedings. <p/> In the light of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant's appeal in part in so far as it related to the decision on the costs of the appeal and reduced the amount awarded to EUR 513,00 (Article 351(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, read in conjunction with Article 358(5) of the Civil Procedure Code), dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment under appeal of the Court of First Instance in the remaining part (Article 353 of the Civil Procedure Code), without any change in that amount. <p/> The applicant was only partially successful in its appeal and the Court of Appeal therefore decided, pursuant to Article 154(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, read in conjunction with Article 165(1) of the same Act, that it should bear its own costs of the appeal. The defendant is ordered to bear its own costs of the response to the appeal, since it did not contribute substantially to the decision (Article 155(1) in conjunction with Article 165(1) of the CPC).",Legal/Regulation

"Resources <p/> Genealogy discovers and records personal information about individuals and, according to their relationship to each other, groups them together in family links in a specific time and place. In this study, the genealogist intervenes in history and relates family history to the general history, so he or she must at least be familiar with its landmarks and characteristics, such as: <p/> The language and scripts used in the archival material. <p/> Coats of arms and emblems used e.g. on seals, medals, coins. <p/> State and church arrangements. <p/> Customs and customs of society. <p/> Written and other sources of information (e.g. gravestones, votive stones, monuments). <p/> There is a very wide and varied range of genealogical resources and tools of all kinds on the web. You can find them by searching for general keywords such as: genealogy, genealogy, family tree, etc., or by narrowing your search to more specific search terms. Genealogical research generates a large amount of data which, without software support, is difficult to organise into meaningful wholes shortly after the genealogist has researched his or her immediate family. <p/> In Slovenia, Brother's Keeper is still the most popular genealogy software. It has the advantage over others of being translated into Slovene and of supporting the special characters of our alphabet. Among the more modern programmes, the more modern Family Tree Builder (FTB) My Heritage meets these requirements, and there may be others. The procedure for downloading a BK programme from the web is presented in two parts - downloading and adapting. The procedure is also described on the Slovenian Genealogy page, where there are many other useful links. <p/> A pointer to many genealogical resources has been provided by some of the more active genealogists on their websites. For example, colleagues Fonda and Zavodnik. The most complete worldwide genealogical signpost is certainly www.cyndislist.com. Among the domestic resources, we should mention SiStory, where some special issues of the journal Trees have been published, DLib, where, among others, the Lexicon of the Drava Banovina is published, and Kamra (Digitised Cultural Heritage of Slovenian Landscapes). <p/> For searching for persons abroad, there are worldwide genealogical data repositories such as Ancestry.

"Kurtic finally takes Allegri away <p/> Ljubljana - Massimiliano Allegri paid dearly for Milan's painful defeat against Sassuolo, for whom Slovenian international Jasmin Kurtic also plays. The former Perugia coach was left without a job the day after the defeat. <p/> Massimiliano Allegri announced some time ago that he would retire from the Milan bench at the end of the season. The 3:4 defeat against Sassuolo, after the rossoneri had already led 2:0, meant that his story on the bench of the seven-time European champions had already ended a few months earlier.

The following fermentation phase is the most delicate part of the black tea production process.

During this process, the leaves are coloured black, and finally the tea leaves are dried with hot air and separated by size through sieves. <p/> In general, black tea has a stronger flavour and contains more caffeine than less oxidised tea (green, oolong or white). Unlike other teas, it retains its flavour for several years and, despite oxidation during processing, acts as an antioxidant. <p/> Flavouring tea became popular in the 19th century.The most famous flavoured black tea is undoubtedly Earl Grey with bergamot oil, but other flavourings are also used (vanilla, coconut, almond, mint, etc.).",Information/Explanation

"[Claustra Alpium Iuliarum, tractus Italiae circa Alpes and the problem of the defence of Italy in the final post-Roman period] <p/> Abstract <p/> Recently, several works have been published that deal, either partially or more comprehensively, with the prison system of the claustra Alpium Iuliarum, its incorporation into the little-known tractus Italiae circa Alpes, and the large-scale problem of the defence of northern Italy in the Late Roman period. In the first set of problems, the author deals with the uncertainty of the dating of the military fortifications of the claustra system and with the late dating of the prison walls. He briefly attempts to identify the fortifications of the tract, which he sees as a broader defence of Italy than just a sector in the Julian Alps. In the last two sections, he discusses the chronology and typological characteristics of the fortified highland outposts, which take on a purely military character in a certain segment and in certain places, and points to a defence of Italy that extended in depth.",Information/Explanation

"Multimodal transport is the transport of goods all the way to the place where the goods will be handed over by the multimodal transport contractor. Here, two modern means of transport from two different transport industries are used simultaneously. Here, the first means of transport together with the cargo becomes the cargo for the second means of transport from the other transport sector, on the basis of one multimodal transport contract and one document, irrespective of the type and number of means of transport used. Therefore, in multimodal transport, the role of the customer of the multimodal transport is important. This branch of transport is complex, and a good multimodal transport contractor is therefore well placed to organise and execute multimodal transport at all levels. The multimodal transport contractor has an interest in performing contractual and non-contractual obligations as a good contractor, since it is liable from the moment of receipt of the goods until the moment of handover. It is also liable for the conduct of its servants and of other persons hired by it for the performance of the multimodal transport contract. It is therefore very important that the multimodal transport contractor adequately insures its liability, as it has no influence on the various risks it faces. The aim of this thesis is to explore in more detail multimodal transport, the multimodal transport contractor and its liability in multimodal transport.",Research Article

"World No Tobacco Day this year over advertisers Smoking kills six million people worldwide every year, and in Slovenia it takes 3,600 lives annually. On World No Tobacco Day, there are warnings about the dangers of smoking, including second-hand smoke. The horrifying statistics that six million people die every year from smoking worldwide, 600 000 from passive smoking, and 3 600 lives are lost annually in Slovenia, 900 of them under the age of 60, speak for themselves. If we do not change our tobacco use patterns, as many as one billion people will die from tobacco in the world in the 21st century. <p/> Worldwide, 1.3 billion people smoke. If smoking were reduced by between 20 and 25 per cent, as many as 100 million premature deaths would be prevented by 2020. This makes it one of the most preventable deaths, but efforts are still lacking because the tobacco industry holds the reins. <p/> Stop the tobacco industry's marketing! The theme of this year's World No Tobacco Day, first proclaimed by the World Health Organization in 1987, is Stop Tobacco Marketing! Helena Koprivnikar from the Institute for Health Protection of the Republic of Slovenia warns that marketing is one of the most important causes of the spread of tobacco use and that urgent action is needed to prevent and reduce the prevalence of smoking among adolescents and young adults and to complement measures to reduce smoking among adults. In the European Union, 70% of smokers start smoking before the age of 18. <p/> According to the Institute for Health Protection, 24% of the population aged 15-64 in Slovenia smokes, more men (27%) than women (21%). The proportion of male smokers has been increasing in recent years, mainly at the expense of the proportion of female smokers. The proportion of adolescents and young adults who smoke is largely stable, but the proportion of adolescent women who smoke has increased. Among adolescents aged 11-15, just over 29% have tried smoking, more boys than girls. <p/> New Tobacco Directive with tougher restrictions The European Union is currently negotiating a proposal for a new Tobacco Directive that would completely ban the advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products. This includes the introduction of large composite warnings, which would include colour photographs in addition to text and would cover 75% of the front and back of cigarette packs and rolling tobacco. It also provides for a ban on the sale of tobacco products with distinctive flavourings and additives that give the impression that the tobacco product is less harmful to health. <p/> European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Tonio Borg, urged Members of the European Parliament and European Health Ministers to support the proposal for a new Tobacco Products Directive and stressed the importance of efforts to reduce the attractiveness of smoking and tobacco products to young people. <p/> Free smoking cessation programmes in Slovenia Nataša Blažko from the Ministry of Health said that Slovenia is a strong supporter of the new directive as tobacco is a major burden in Slovenia, explaining that the proposal brings changes in a number of areas, but also adds new areas, such as the treatment of electronic and herbal cigarettes. The Ministry of Health financially supports various programmes aimed at preventing young people from starting to smoke and at smoking cessation in all population groups. Slovenia is one of the few countries where primary health care provides free smoking cessation programmes. B. T.

"Renče during World War I <p/> A captured moment of the demolition of the Renče church bell tower during World War I in 1916. The Austrian High Command decided that the Renče church bell tower and the chimneys of the surrounding brickworks should be demolished so that they would not serve as an orientation point for the Italians. After the fall of Gorizia in the Sixth Battle of the Soča on 9 August 1916, Renče found itself in close proximity to the military operations on the Soča Front. The Austro-Hungarian line of defence ran only a few kilometres away from Renče: over St. Mark's Hill above Šempeter, the hills of Vrtojben and Biljen, crossing the Vipava River at Miren and ascending to the Karst past Miren Castle. The Italians wanted to cross the relatively low hills into the Vipava valley. More shells fell on Renče every day, and the village slowly began to turn into a pile of rubble. ... <p/> Renče Square during the First World War. The houses and the church show the effects of the bombing. <p/> Those inhabitants who had not yet taken refuge had to leave their hometowns in the greatest haste. From the newspapers of the time, we learn that they stayed in various places (Ljubljana, Novo mesto, Zagorje ob Savi, Loidelstahl in Lower Austria, Hollern, Gertaus and Pachfurt in the Bruck district of Lithuania) and camps (Wagna, Bruck, Steinklamm, Mlatz in Bohemia) in the then Austro-Hungarian monarchy. <p/> The interior of the Rhenish church after the demolition of the bell tower in 1916. <p/> Church and secular authorities also had to move.

The Renče parish had its seat on Rimska cesta in Ljubljana in October 1916, and from May to October it was in Št. Vid above Ljubljana. In December 1917, the parish was temporarily located in Ajdovščina, and the parish priest Valentin Pipan moved from Renče to Vedrijan. <p/> View of Renče from the bell tower looking north.

"Japan - Kyoto and Geishas <p/> The English writer, explorer, photographer and naturalist Isabella Bird once wrote that Japan offers as much novelty as a trip to another planet. From imposing shrines surrounded by fairy-tale forests, to snow-capped Mount Fuji, to shy and agile geishas, to neon-lit skyscrapers, to punctual and fast trains, Japan conjures up many associations... Japan is a unique synthesis of the traditional and the modern, where ancient gods, traditions, skills and arts meet cutting-edge modern technology, futuristic fashion and the latest style and design. Japan is a country that is a feast for all the senses. Japan was still feudal in the second half of the 19th century, but at the end of that century, rapid industrialisation began. But after the Second World War, Japan emerged as a true economic giant. <p/> Kyoto <p/> The former imperial capital boasts many temples, palaces, shrines and gardens. Kyoto is also famous for its highly developed traditional arts and festivals. Kyoto was the imperial capital of Japan from 794 until 1868, when Meji moved it to Tokyo. Nevertheless, Kyoto retains the primacy of Japan's cultural sophistication. In a way, Kyoto is complementary to Nara, where the foundations of traditional Japanese culture were laid, culminating in Kyoto. Kyoto has a huge number of attractions, so I will concentrate only on the most important ones. <p/> Kiyomizudera <p/> The Temple of Pure Water - Kiyomizudera - is one of the most important temples in Japan and is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was founded in 778 on the site of the Otowa Waterfall in eastern Kyoto. The main temple as we see it today was built in 1633 by the shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu, who, among other things, expelled all Europeans and Christians from Japan and closed the borders of Japan, which lasted for more than 200 years afterwards. The temple was built without a single nail. Kiyomizudera Temple is best known for its 13-metre-high wooden platform, which offers visitors a fine view of the many cherry and maple trees as well as the city of Kyoto in the distance. Below the temple is the Otowa Waterfall, which is divided into three smaller waterfalls. The water from each waterfall has its own health and well-being benefits. You can drink the water from a cup located on a long wooden pole. The water of the first waterfall is good for long life, the second for success in school and life and the third for happiness and love in life. But don't be partial, you can only drink the water of one ""waterfall"". <p/> Behind the main hall of the Kiyomizu Dera Temple stands the Jishu Shrine, dedicated to the deity of love and matchmaking. In front of the temple there are two stones 18 metres apart. If you can find your way from one to the other with your eyes closed, you will be lucky in your search for love, but if you need someone to guide you from one stone to the other, you may also need an intermediary in your search for a life mate. <p/> The Higashiyama district is one of the best preserved old areas of the city, located between Kiyomizu Temple and Yasaka Shrine. Walking through the narrow streets, between the wooden buildings and traditional shops, it's easy to feel the flavour of the old capital. Many small shops and restaurants have catered for locals, tourists and pilgrims for centuries. On a walk through the quarter, we also caught a geisha going about her business, and she was happy to pose for us. <p/> 1 of 3 <p/> Kodaiji Temple, founded in 1606 in memory of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of Japan's greatest historical figures, and commissioned by his wife Nene, is also remarkable. <p/> Toyotomi Hideyoshi was a warrior, politician, samurai, general and daimyo - a nobleman subject only to the shogun - who had 26 famous Christians crucified, known as the Japanese martyrs. Kodaiji Temple belongs to the Rinzai sect of Zen Buddhism. The temple is surrounded by gardens and we also walked through a beautiful bamboo grove. <p/> One of Kyoto's most famous shrines, Yasaka, is only a good half hour's walk from Kiyomizu Temple, but of course the walk takes a while, and we could easily have stayed here for an hour longer. The shrine was founded around 650 AD. In front of the main shrine there is a stage with hundreds of lamps that light up in the evening. Each lamp bears the name of a local company that pays a donation. <p/> Fushimi Inari Shrine <p/> Fushimi Inari is an important Shinto shrine in the southern part of Kyoto. It is famous for its thousand orange or brilliant red torii, which lead through the forest to the 233-metre-high Inari Sacred Mountain, an integral part of the shrine. <p/> Fushimi Inari is one of the most important of the thousands of shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto goddess of rice. The shrine is also full of statues of foxes, which were the messengers of the goddess Inari. Fushimi Inari Shrine is of ancient origin and existed before Kyoto became the capital of Japan in 794. <p/> 1 of 4 <p/> Arashiyama <p/> Arashiyama is a pleasant tourist district on the western outskirts of Kyoto. The area has been a popular destination since Japan was given its first permanent capital, Naro, in 710. The capital at the time flirted with the Chinese capital. Large Buddhist temples were built at this time. Chinese influence was diminishing, although it was still great, or rather many things were submerged. Perhaps the first association we have with Arashiyama is the extremely attractive bamboo forest. <p/> The most important temple in Arashiyama is Tenryuji. It is one of the five great Zen temples of Kyoto and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This temple also has its own Rinzai Zen school of the Rinzai sect of Japanese Buddhism. The temple was built as early as 1339, when the Shogun Ashikaga Takauji ruled, and was dedicated to the then deceased Emperor Go-Daiga. A walk along the pond and through the temple's tatami trees is a real Arashiyama experience. <p/> Golden Pavilion - Kinkakuji <p/> The Golden Pavilion - Kinkakuji is a Zen temple whose upper two floors are entirely gilded with gold leaf. Previously known as Rokuonji, the temple was the resting villa of Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, and according to his will, after his death in 1408, it became a Rinzai sect Zen temple. In front of the temple is a beautiful pond. The temple has burned down several times in its history, most recently in 1950 by a fanatical monk, but was rebuilt again in 1955. <p/> Kyoto Imperial Palace <p/> Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence of the Japanese Imperial Family until 1868, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo. It is located in Kyoto's Imperial Park, along with the Sento Imperial Palace and several other landmarks. <p/> The present Imperial Palace was rebuilt in 1855 after it burnt down. The complex is surrounded by walls and ramparts, with halls and gardens inside. Only the current Emperor Akihito was crowned in Tokyo, the previous ones in Kyoto. <p/> Of course, there are more temples and sights. Kyoto is also famous for its geishas, of which there are around 300, including at least two Europeans.",Opinion/Argumentation
"7. Fridays and Saints' Days <p/> First Friday and the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in June. Renewal of our consecration. Maybe for the first time, maybe for the tenth time? For the Diocese of Ljubljana, Bishop Gregory Rozman announced the celebration of nine First Fridays in 1941. Seventy years have now passed since then. That is a long lifetime, but some ninety-year-olds can still remember this inter-war event. The Bishop was concerned about the growing unbelief among the people and he explained the devotion of First Fridays as making reparation to the Heart of Jesus for all offences against God and also against the Church. That year, the war struck with only the first sweep, and the anti-religious spirit had been obviously and secretly at work for a long time. The Bishop called for repentance and respect for God's commandments. Is this call unnecessary today? Let us take a look at two families that call themselves Christian. After all, it does not even matter how many children they have. In the first, the day begins around six o'clock in the morning for the parent, and a little later for the schoolchild. They don't even see each other in the morning. The parents have a quick morning coffee, no time to even cross themselves and they are already on the carriageway. They all have lunch together later in the afternoon, and the aces don't even say goodbye. In the evening, the TV news is on and the schoolboy has a pile of homework for the next school day. It's fast approaching, and because the boy is independent - as he has to be - he takes the time to heat something up in the microwave, have a quick wash and throw his nice, friendly, ""... good night, Mom. ' They go to Mass on Sundays several times and the boy doesn't feel bad at all at the service. But, he thinks, we don't pray much at home, even though Grandma often reminds us about it. They don't even have breakfast together in the second morning, but they pray first before lunch. They also pray together in the evening. On Sundays, they go to Mass in their own way, the parents are the readers of the readings, and the children are the singers and altar servers. The family resolution for the new calendar year is different each time, most often of a charitable nature. Neither the first nor the second family thinks particularly of the First Fridays, but neither of them allows anyone to dishonour any person or any religion. There are many families like this nowadays. If you put their religious life on a human scale, it would probably swing. Nor would a geometric measurement show the same line for the boundary of the spiritual. Let alone in families where there is hardly a whiff of faith left. What about those to whom faith is completely alien. What of those who are opposed to faith. The call to conversion is still needed. Perhaps ever more so. But it is necessary to know how to hear it. Yet, as loud and frequent as it is, it cannot touch ears that do not listen. The condition for a different way through the spiritual world is the willingness not to turn a deaf ear to Christian values and virtues. Faith is chief among them. Bl. It was very dear to Slomšek. He called it the light of faith, faith be your light. How precious light is, however, is best known in the darkness. Do we not find ourselves in darkness even when we cannot help ourselves in difficult circumstances? The smallest bit of faith can make it a little brighter. Trusting in God's mercy and help is that sliver of light. In the mystical vision of St. Faustina Kowalska, Jesus instructed her to pray much for the poor. She was a hidden pray for people she did not know. God would be caught in his own snare if he did not keep his promises. We have no influence on how and when they come true, other than our own perseverance in trust. All things work together for good to those who love God, says the Apostle Paul. Paul says in his Letter to the Romans (Rom 8:28), and adds. We must trust. On Fridays and holy days.",Opinion/Argumentation
"The Rectors' Conference of the four Slovenian public universities met in Maribor at the weekend for its first meeting since the University of Maribor took over the two-year presidency of the informal association. According to the Rector of the University of Maribor, Zdravko Kačič, the meeting focused, among other things, on the establishment of the e-Nakvis information system. <p/> Regarding the implementation of the system, which is experiencing some technical problems, Kačič said that they expect its quality implementation and smooth operation within six months, in line with a positive user experience. <p/> In addition to Kačič, the rectors - Igor Papič from the University of Ljubljana, Klavdija Kutnar from the University of Primorska and Danilo Zavrtanik from the University of Nova Gorica and his colleagues - also discussed the importance of the functioning of key support activities of universities related to the implementation of integrated career orientation for students, graduates and other target groups. <p/>The competent Ministry of Education, Science and Sport was called upon to ensure continued and continuous funding for the operation of university career centres and centres set up to support teaching, as these activities are a necessary part of regular higher education activities. According to Mr Kačič, these are funded on a project basis and are due to expire this year, so it would be advisable to start with permanent funding. <p/> There was also a discussion on legislation concerning universities, in particular the harmonisation of the law on research and development and the amendment to the law on higher education. The fall of the government was not the best thing for them, as they were on the verge of getting the draft laws through the parliamentary procedure. Kačič therefore hopes that they will not have to start all over again with the arrival of a new government. <p/> Papič also regrets that they are back at the point of two years ago, when the legislation was also practically in place, but after the elections the whole thing fell into the water. With a new minister, they have reached a point where a working group has already handed over a draft law on research to the ministry, but now the resignation of the government is putting the whole thing in doubt again. <p/> The rectors of the two Seaside universities are of a similar opinion. Kutnarjeva would like whoever takes office in the new government to accept the bulk of the law already drafted by the profession and send it for further consideration as soon as possible, while Zavrtanik regrets that they behaved somewhat neuralgically at the end of its coordination, since otherwise, with some pragmatic solutions, the law could perhaps have been in parliamentary procedure today. <p/> The Rectors also took note of a promotional video entitled Slovenia. Green. Creative. Smart, and they also addressed an initiative to the public agency Spirit to include in such films promoting the country in the future a presentation of its development potential, represented by the scientific and research work of universities and institutes.",News

"Demand for timber construction is still generally quite modest for the most part, so it makes sense for countries to encourage it through various measures. <p/> Finland's wood building promotion programme is already showing results <p/> The use of wood in construction has become more popular again in recent years, with some countries promoting it through specific measures. This is also the case in Finland, where a seven-year wood building promotion programme is already showing results. According to Petri Heino, administrator of the programme, key measures include changes in legislation and financial incentives. <p/> Demand for timber construction is still generally quite modest, so it makes sense for countries to promote it through various measures, said Petri Heino of the Finnish Ministry of the Environment. ""Governments can provide, among other things, changes in legislation, financial incentives and the dissemination of good practice examples to promote sustainable construction,"" he said. <p/> In Finland, he said, it is by combining these three measures that progress has been made. ""We have been able to involve a wide range of stakeholders in promotional activities,"" he said, recalling the size and indirect positive effects of the construction sector. <p/> Finns have had subsidies for the construction of wooden houses for several years, and since the beginning of this year the government has increased them further. The amount varies depending on the region; for example, in the Helsinki metropolitan area, the subsidy is €15,000. <p/> In Finland, a specific programme is being implemented under the auspices of the Ministry of the Environment to promote timber construction in the period 2016-2022, which aims, among other things, to foster the growth of an internationally competitive timber construction industry, both in terms of know-how and domestic production, and to support the sustainable use of forest resources. <p/>The programme's objectives include a ten per cent annual growth in the construction of wooden residential buildings, as well as an increase in the carbon sequestration potential of wood products, the share of wood in public buildings and the export of wood products. ""The mid-term review of the results, carried out in 2018, showed that the activities have had a positive impact in most of the target areas,"" Heino pointed out. <p/> The use of wood in construction is commonplace in Finland, he said, as they have extensive forests that are producing more annual growth than ever before. It is currently at around 110 million cubic metres, of which between 65 and 70 per cent is felled. <p/> Young Finns are also aware of the importance of wood. According to Hein, a recent study showed that 69 per cent of girls between the ages of 14 and 23 support the idea of increasing wood use. <p/> Slovenia is also working to further promote wood as a renewable resource and an opportunity to enhance the added value of products. Among other things, the country aims to achieve a 30% share of wood in public buildings and to increase domestic log processing to three million cubic metres per year. <p/> Heino said that while the starting points are encouraging, it will be useful to further address these issues in the future through changes in legislation, educational content and various policies. <There are also opportunities for cooperation between the two countries. ""There is already informal cooperation at ministerial level, and we are also cooperating in the research field, where there are opportunities to build on,"" he added.",News
"I can't help but notice that on 4 May 2004, D.R.I. were supposed to open their concert in Gali hala Metelkova with a skateboarding competition in the courtyard in front of the above-mentioned venue. The rain prevented any sporting events during the day, but the quartet from San Francisco (allegedly) rocked the inside of the hall, while I stayed at home in front of the book and concentrated on the exam I had scheduled for the next day - Fail. <p/> It's been more than 7 years to the day, the day the Dirty Rotten Imbeciles showed up again at the same venue.

Or you can type in a place like Ljubljana and get Ljubljana treasures, etc... If you want to do more, like see what's going on with individual treasures or even enter your own adventures related to the treasure you're looking for, you have to register for free. If you do this, you will get the geographical coordinates of where the treasure is located and a hint of where exactly it should be. You can stand on it, but if the owner of the treasure doesn't give you a hint that it's buried under your feet, you'll be looking for it in vain. You can, however, pay approx. 20?per year, which gives you the right to hide the treasure, enter its coordinates in the portal and keep track of what happens to it, who discovers it, etc. If you find the treasure, you enter the date of its discovery in the treasure's notebook. You can take some things out and put in some of your new things, or at least as much as there was before. Each treasure contains a plastic waterproof box, a label with the location and address, a pencil, a pencil sharpener, and a notebook or notepad. You can also put anything in the box that is not food, not an animal or non-perishable. Crates can be ""micro"" e.g. a 2 or 3 cm plastic box, medium or very large. The crate can also contain a ""tracer"" or a plastic coin. You need to buy both official ones because the tracking numbers are stamped on the tracker and the coins are destructible and only made by certified producers. The tracker is inscribed separately and its job is to travel from treasure to treasure. You must not take it home for permanent safekeeping, but must put it in another treasure or leave it where it is. If you have moved it, you must be sure to write on the portal in which treasure you have placed it. Some people call this a ""stopwatch"". Vendors also offer official boxes, notebooks, pencils, stickers, etc. You don't need these if you don't want them. You can provide all this yourself. You can get free stickers here: http://www.techblazer.com/geocaching-log-sheets/ for micro for others: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=w ... mApU8vtHzw Make sure the sticker is dry! That's all. Instead of boring walks, you can search for treasures. You can use a garmin or other gps, I just use a phone with gps built in. It's worth installing Google Earth and you'll find your treasure even faster. If anyone has any other questions, just take them on the day. <p/> Reply Written by bucar "" Sat May 05, 2012 12:13 am <p/> Commendable, but one has to be careful here: it's nice if a video post about a treasure is aligned with its owner, especially if the location of the box itself is also shown (spoiler).

Some time ago there was a pop-TV article http://24ur.com/novice/it/sodobno-iskan ... ladov.html and later on Spica there was another box right next to the real one and now there is quite a confusion because there are two treasures with a registration book.

"On this JULY CULTURE DAY, or the birthday of Františ Prešeren, some of us poetry lovers gathered to meet the poet Robert Simoniškės, who was visiting our school as part of the Inviting the Word project, facilitated by the Slovene Writers' Association (Stowarzyszenie Slovenije pisateljev). In an hour and a half, Robert Simonišek showed us the other side of poetry, showed us what a poem can be, encouraged us to think about more challenging texts, to think about poetic freedom, the structure of poetry, to talk about Slovenian attitudes towards poetry and to say something about the somewhat bitter topic that we are reluctant to talk about, that sometimes Slovenian lessons have the opposite effect and discourage young people from poetry. Malgajev people are trying to change this by inviting real poets to speak, by daring to talk about pressing issues and by allowing the poetic language the freedom it has won in the world of art.

Raising awareness among the membership and the general population about the importance of cardiovascular disease prevention has been, is and will continue to be a constant feature of our work. <p/> The reports were adopted unanimously by the branch representatives present. <p/> In short, we can report that we have achieved most of the tasks we set ourselves in our work programme. <p/> We would like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the innovations that have marked the Slovenian prevention scene, in particular the measurement of the ankle-brachial index, the atrial fibrillation prevention programme, for which we have been awarded a global prize since the end of 2011, and the establishment of the 25 × 25 network of NGOs in the field of public health. All three of these innovations have been widely covered by the Slovenian media.

The regional development agency must identify the area in need of special assistance and submit a time- and cost-estimated programme of additional development tasks in that area, specifying the objectives, the task promoters, the expected results and the indicators. Funds may be granted for a maximum period of two years. If, at the end of the programme of additional development tasks, the conditions for funding additional development tasks in the region are still met, a new programme may be drawn up. The eligible costs are staff costs and the costs of preparing the programme and projects related to addressing the identified development problems in the area in need of development assistance. Eligible costs are financed at 100 %.

A development region receiving development aid under a special law shall not be eligible for additional funding under this paragraph. <p/> (4) The funds granted may be disbursed on the basis of reports submitted on the activities carried out. <p/> (1) In accordance with Article 35 of the Act on the Promotion of Coherent Regional Development, assistance to municipalities for the municipal improvement of Roma settlements shall be granted as special regional incentives in priority areas facing major structural problems. <p/> (2) The following municipalities shall be eligible for the assistance referred to in the preceding paragraph: <p/> - in which a representative of the Roma community is elected to the municipal council in accordance with the law governing local self-government, or <p/> - in which a special working body of the municipal council for monitoring the situation of the Roma community is set up in accordance with the provisions of the law governing the situation of the Roma community, the members of which are also representatives of the Roma community. <p/> (3) The Service shall carry out a public call for tenders or invite eligible municipalities to submit projects within the indicative quota referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article. In the call for tenders or invitation to tender, the Service shall specify the documentation to be submitted for the grant of assistance and the time limit for submission. If the call for proposals procedure is used, the Service may set the municipality a deadline for completing the project proposal. The Service shall prepare a programme proposal which shall be adopted by the Government. <p/> (4) The indicative quotas for the eligible municipalities shall be calculated on the basis of the available amount of funds in the budget item of the Service, the total number of eligible municipalities, an assessment of the equipment of Roma settlements with water supply, electricity, sewerage and transport infrastructure, the number of registered voters of the Roma community in the municipality and the funds allocated to the municipality on the basis of Articles 21 to 23 of the Act on the Financing of Municipalities (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No. 123/09, 101/07 - Decree of the European Parliament No. 101/07, and Article 57/08). <p/> (5) Aid may be granted to co-finance the following projects in Roma settlements: <p/> - water supply systems, including intakes and pipelines to the user's connection, <p/> - sewerage networks, where these are necessary to protect water resources or for other ecological requirements, <p/> - electrification of agglomerations, <p/> - new or reconstructed local roads and paths, <p/> - purchase of land for the improvement and completion of settlements. <p/> (6) In the case of land purchase, a ceiling for co-financing per square metre of land purchased shall be set in the invitation to tender or call for tenders, irrespective of the contract price. <p/> (7) Contracts for the allocation of funds may be multiannual, taking into account the contractual commitments already entered into in previous years when determining the annual quota available. <p/> (8) Projects shall be co-financed up to 100 %. <p/> Article 12 <p/> (Financing of programme implementation costs under special laws) <p/> Notwithstanding the co-financing of development tasks at regional level which are in the public interest in accordance with Article 10 of this Regulation, the total costs of the preparation and implementation of a special programme by a regional development agency shall be financed under a special contract, but these costs may represent no more than three per cent of the value of the special programme. <p/> Article 13 <p/> (Emergency regional policy measures) <p/> (1) A regional incentive may be granted to self-governing local authorities and individuals as an emergency regional policy measure in specific unforeseeable circumstances arising from a natural, ecological or other disaster. <p/> (2) Urgent regional policy measures referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be implemented in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14 of the Regulation on the granting of regional State aid (Official Journal of the RS, No 72/06, 70/07, 99/08 and 17/09). <p/> III.

The boys are aware that several players are candidates for the starting eleven at certain positions, and they are fulfilling all their obligations with 100 per cent commitment. In training, the coaching staff tried out some innovations and implemented one of them during the match. Martin Milec played half-time as a right-back and after the match against Drau he said: ""I joked that I had a headache this time because I had to think more in my new position (laughs). It was good for the first attempt to play in a changed role against a slightly weaker opponent. I was still good on the offensive end, but I have to make sure I get in sync with the defensive line. Maybe I can play another game in this position in the future. "" <p/> Together with his teammates, the young Slovenian international was eager to start the competitive part of his preparations.

"Fairy tales and stories <p/> ABOUT Fairy tales and songs <p/> Children, do you like fairy tales and songs? I love them so much! It's cold outside and I'm writing these animal stories for you. My thoughts rush back to my childhood in the Slovenian Highlands. I see our family - the Ježe family, we were told - gathered in a vineyard around a kerosene lamp. Mica is reading stories, my father is mending shoes, the rest of us are shelling pumpkins for oil, sifting buckwheat for kasha sausages, shredding corn off the cob for corn fritters or sifting beans. Some women spin. <p/> No, I can't say that the somewhat pale light of the kerosene lamp made my childhood any sadder, on the contrary, it was quite joyful, full of curiosity, longing and duty.... <p/> In the dim glow of the kerosene lamp, the shadows in the corners and haylofts were full of fears, especially when our neighbour Ferdinand - the eternal young man - told us about the enchanted queens in the enchanted castle, about the dragon who had come for the castle's daughter, about the serpent in the spring, about the witches, the devil, the goblins, and about death. Fairy tales about the nuns and the judges must have been told to each other by the ancient Slavs. And Ferdinand had to tell us the happy one about the ""ass-gold"" several times. <p/> It was cold outside. Snow covered the hill and down the hill, and smoke from the chimneys of the dwarf wood-houses was drawn straight up into the sky, across which the mysterious moon passed from time to time. But it was warm behind the frosted shutters. A fire crackled in the stove or in the cooker. Somewhere in the distance, on another hill, dogs barked and howled at the pale moon... <p/> At that time, when I was young, nature was still clean. There was laughter and weeping, songs and quarrels, and then again visits, feasts, baptisms, funerals and carols. <p/> Today, all that is very different. After the first, a second war, four years of suffering and misery each time. Between the wars, life changes. The Partisans liberated our homeland, we erected memorials to our dead heroes. We began to live a new life, as our greatest hero, Tito, had envisioned in his early youth. <p/> Today, instead of a kerosene lamp in the middle of a pile of beans on the table, a light bulb from the ceiling glows. Electricity lights, heats, drives machines and cooks. Today, it is not Ferdinand telling the neighbour's fairy tales. We sit in front of the television and see and hear what is happening in our homeland and far beyond. We talk long distances and call acquaintances by pressing the electric bell... <p/> We could hardly have dreamt of all this in our youth. But nature was cleaner, wider and quieter. Perhaps at carnivals or at feasts, village musicians would swish. And on occasions, the song came straight from the throat, not from the radio or from gramophone records. It came from the heart, our beautiful Slovenian song. <p/> The past turned into memories. I can still see my mother looking after me when I go out into the world, to art, to Golden Prague. After many years, I have returned to my Slovenian hills, among you, to tell you some animal tales, sing a song, make a clay sculpture and paint a picture.

"Baselines. Psychiatric patients, and especially alcoholics, are subject to stigmatisation, negative social perceptions and prejudices. The aim of our study was to examine the stigmatization and self-stigmatization of alcoholics in our cultural setting comparatively with regard to gender, alcohol consumption, alcoholic identity, age and educational structure. <p/>Methods. We used a semi-structured questionnaire with items related to different social perceptions regarding alcoholics. Respondents (n = 337) were sampled in an Alcoholism Treatment Dispensary and two general/family medicine outpatient clinics. Data were processed using t-test and factor analysis. <p/>Results. Women had more negative perceptions and more empathy towards alcoholics, men were more lenient and lacked empathy towards addicts, people with no identity as an alcoholic had more negative perceptions, both negative and positive perceptions loaded more with age, and both negative and positive perceptions loaded less and empathic perceptions of alcoholics loaded more with higher education. <p/>Conclusions. In our cultural environment, the stigmatization of alcoholics is very high and stronger than self-stigmatization. With higher education, it fades. Therapists involved in the treatment of alcoholics have had to revise our own perceptions of the stigmatisation of our patients, which will also influence our therapeutic approach. <p/>From social psychology comes the theoretical knowledge of implicit perceptions that we are rarely aware of, but which nevertheless have a profound influence on our behaviour and attitudes towards other people. Kelly observed that if we have dual information about people, we first follow our first impression and the information we have received from others. These perceptions give rise to prejudice, which is negative ideas about other people.1 The theory of social perceptions was pioneered by Moscovici in 1961.2 They represent the social knowledge of a group of people: a system of ideas, values and behavioural patterns that facilitates communication between members of the same group.3 Social perceptions are the basis for individual thinking and knowledge and are the result of an ongoing dialogue between members of the same group.4 They are the basis of attributions about how we understand other people's behaviour.5 Research on adult populations has pointed to three different conclusions about the stigma of mental disorders.6 The first is that people with mental disorders are more stigmatised than people with physical illnesses, and that those who abuse alcoholic beverages are more stigmatised than people with mental disorders. Another finding is that stereotypes associate mental disorders with irresponsibility and danger in individuals, leading to negative emotional reactions and discriminatory behaviour. The third finding is that personal knowledge of mentally disordered individuals reduces stigma. It also identifies discrimination due to self-stigmatisation.7 The character of the drinker is inferred from the drinker's behaviour under the influence of alcohol. The more he or she drinks, the stricter our judgement. Although we often stigmatise drinkers who drink larger quantities of alcoholic beverages, we often perceive them to be more cheerful. Our own drinking habits have a big influence on our judgement. Thus, heavy drinkers do not judge other drinkers as strongly as moderate drinkers or teetotalers.8 The aim of the present study is to determine social perceptions of alcoholics both in the general population and among alcoholics, and to identify differences in perceptions according to drinking patterns, age, gender and education. Our working hypotheses were that self-stigmatisation of alcoholics is greater than that of non-problem drinkers and that stigmatisation by relatives is milder than that by those who have no experience of living with an alcoholic. <p/> Methods <p/> Sample <p/> A questionnaire was distributed to patients in three outpatient clinics. The first group of patients was a group of alcohol-dependent patients and their relatives who are under treatment in the Dispensary for the Treatment of Alcoholism and Other Addictions at the Dr. Adolf Drolc Health Centre in Maribor. The other two groups of patients were sampled consecutively in two general medicine outpatient clinics from the same health centre. One outpatient clinic was selected in the city centre, the other in Lovrenec na Pohorju. In total, 337 completed questionnaires were obtained. 149 men and 188 women completed them. The whole sample was divided several times into several subgroups, which were then compared with each other. 146 of them had the experience of living with a person who is dependent on alcohol. 60 were alcohol dependent and 49 were alcohol abusers. In terms of educational structure, most of them had a vocational education (71 or 21.1%), a secondary education (88 or 26%) and a higher education (98 or 29.1%). The mean age of the subjects was 41.4 years + 13.9 years. The group sampled at the Alcoholism and Other Drug Treatment Dispensary included 11 alcoholics who had been in treatment for less than six months and 31 who had been in treatment for six months or more. The results of their relatives' group were added to a group of people from the general population who answered yes to the question whether anyone in their family was a frequent drinker. <p/> Instrument <p/> Description of the instrument <p/> We constructed an instrument containing independent variables (sex, age, education, family history of binge drinking, whether someone is a recovering alcoholic), 44 items relating to perceptions of alcohol dependence (a five-point scale of agreement), three open-ended statements to be completed (a test of incomplete sentences), and six questions testing attitudes towards drinking. The instrument is reproduced in full in the Annex. <p/> Validity and reliability <p/> The rational validity of the questionnaire was obtained on account of the broad coverage of views (interviewing professionals involved in the treatment of alcohol dependence, interviewing alcohol dependents and people in frequent contact with alcohol dependents [ waitresses ]), the theoretical background on stigmatisation and self-stigmatisation of addicts6-8 and the three experts who analysed the individual items. Factor analysis was used for empirical validity. We extracted five factors which explain 45.14% of the variance. Factor 1 - "" Factor of strongly negative attitudes "" explains 19.16% of the variance, Factor 2 - "" Factor of positive attitudes "" explains 9.50% of the variance, Factor 3 - "" Factor of empathy towards alcoholics "" explains 7.27% of the variance, Factor 4 - "" Factor of empathic attitude "" explains 5.24% of the variance, and Factor 5 - "" Factor of personal accountability and negative perceptions "" explains 3.99% of the variance. External validity was not established because we did not have a pre-existing instrument measuring attitudes towards alcohol dependence. Reliability analysis was carried out using Crombach's coefficient a. This was 0.859, indicating exemplary reliability.9 Item-by-item reliability analysis was also carried out. We found that the reliability of the instrument could have been improved slightly if five items had been dropped, but we decided to keep them as they were items relating to empathy, which was of interest to us in the study. On a smaller sample (n = 20), we further tested the reliability by means of a test-retest method and checked for correlation. <p/> Statistical analysis <p/> Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-11.5 and SPSS-13.0 statistical packages. We were interested in statistically significant differences between the independent variables, considering significant differences at p &lt; 0.05. Comparisons were made using t-test for independent samples and analysis of variance. Factor analysis was also performed. We used the Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) method and the Oblimin oblique rotation method. <p/> Results <p/> Comparison of item differences by gender <p/> Statistically significant differences were found for as many as 20 social perceptions. In the whole sample, women gave more value to negative perceptions (destroying families, aggressive, annoying, would betray and sell everything for alcohol), more to empathic perceptions (seeking oblivion and comfort, not finding their own way out of a crisis, not being able to heal themselves), and a difference was also found for the item preferring to avoid it. Men in the whole sample gave more value to performances from which a defensive attitude could be seen (everyone has some form of addiction, everyone has a reason to get drunk, alcoholics are promiscuous as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they make me feel good about myself, they are cheerful, they put me in a good mood, I prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler), on the other hand, men are less empathetic (I don't care about them, they should pay more for health insurance, an alcoholic is converted when he rolls in a pit), they are more likely to be labelled ""losers"", they are more likely to see alcoholism as a hereditary disease, and they are more likely to prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler than women. <p/> Differences are present for only two items in the whole sample. Alcoholics are preferred by those without experience of living with an alcoholic, and those with experience place more value on the notion that alcoholism is a genetically determined, hereditary disease. <p/> Comparison of item differences according to the rating of being harmful or dependent on alcohol <p/> Differences between these two subgroups of the total sample are present for eight items. People who drink harmfully were more likely to describe alcoholics negatively than alcoholics themselves (they use alcohol as an excuse to fail, they are unreliable, calculating and exploitative), they have no empathy for alcoholics (they don't care about them, they should pay more for health insurance), even though they prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler (they do not care about them, they should pay more for health insurance). Alcohol-dependent people gave more value to the item that it makes them feel bad to see others making fun of alcoholics and that alcoholics feel guilty about their own dependence. <p/> Comparison of item differences on problem drinking <p/> Differences between the subgroups of the full sample are present for nine items. People who were harmful or dependent on alcohol gave higher scores to items that showed leniency towards the dependent and a defensive attitude (everyone has a reason to drink as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they are happy, they put me in a good mood, they make me feel good about myself, everyone has some form of dependence, alcohol is a hereditary disease). People without a problematic attitude towards drinking gave higher value to two items (they are bad guys and I prefer to avoid it). <p/> Comparison of item differences according to the presence of an alcoholic identity <p/> Differences are present for six items. People in the treatment programme with an alcoholic identity gave higher values to items with an empathic perception of alcoholics (they have feelings of guilt, it makes me feel bad when others make fun of them) and to the item that alcoholism is a hereditary disease, while people without this identity gave higher values to items with a negative label (they are unreliable, calculating and exploitative, they use alcohol as an excuse to fail). <p/> Comparison of item differences by age <p/> The total sample was divided into three groups: young people up to 29 years (n = 74), people between 30 and 59 years (n = 220) and people aged 60 and over (n = 39). There was a statistically significant difference for 12 items. For the six items with negative social perceptions (they are wrinkles, they are calculating and exploitative, they are violent and arrogant, they are weak, neglectful and intrusive, and they don't care), the value of the items increases with age everywhere. The three items with positive perceptions (as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they are cheerful, they make me feel good about myself) have the same trend of increasing value with increasing age. Similarly with the item ""I don't care about them"". The item that alcoholism is a response to inner distress was given the highest values by middle-aged people and the lowest values by the oldest generations. For the item that alcoholism is a hereditary disease, the highest values were given by the oldest and the lowest by the youngest people. <p/> Comparison of item differences by education <p/> The educational structure of the total sample was divided into three groups: people with incomplete, completed primary school and vocational secondary school (n = 107), people with completed secondary school (n = 88) and people with completed higher and university education (n = 128). Statistically significant differences are present for 22 items. All negative perceptions (they are wrinkles, they are annoying and disrespectful, they are calculating and exploitative, they are violent and arrogant, they allow themselves too much, they should be treated against their will, they are neglectful, they are disruptive and pushy, alcoholics are promiscuous, they don't care, they are guilty of addiction themselves) are lower in people with higher education and highest in people with the lowest education. Similarly, positive perceptions (everyone has a reason to get drunk as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they are happy, I prefer an alcoholic to a teetotaler, they give me a sense of self-satisfaction, everyone has some form of addiction). Items expressing empathy (I feel sorry for them, I feel bad when others make fun of them) have the reverse trend - higher values at higher education levels. ""I don't care about them"" has the highest weighting for the lowest educated and the lowest for the highest educated. ""Alcoholism is a hereditary disease"" has the highest value in the lowest educated group. <p/> Fig. 1. Differences on the first factor between the subgroup of alcoholics in treatment for less than 6 months (SOA &lt; 6 months), alcoholics in treatment for more than 6 months (SOA &gt; 6 months) and the group of people with no alcoholic identity (control group). <p/>Factor analysis of the sample <p/>The value of the Keiser-Meyer-Olkin test of sample adequacy (0.828) and the result of the Bartlett test (p = 0.000) indicate that there is a significant association between the variables. Five factors were taken into account, together explaining 45.2% of the variance. The first factor explains 19.2% of the variance. It is occupied by strongly negative social perceptions (they are disruptive and intrusive, violent and arrogant, neglectful, annoying and disrespectful, calculating and exploitative, they are wrinkles, they do not care, alcoholics are promiscuous, they would sell and betray everything, they are bad people, they should be treated against their will and they should pay more for health insurance). The second factor explains 9.5% of the variance and is occupied by positive perceptions of alcoholics (they are happy as long as they are not deeply drunk, they are fun, they give me a sense of satisfaction with myself, I prefer them to teetotalers and everyone has a reason to get drunk). The third factor (7.3% of the variance) is occupied by the items of empathic attitudes towards alcoholics (alcoholism is a response to inner distress, I feel bad when others make fun of them, they are victims of childhood, they pity me, they cannot find their own way out of the crisis, they cannot cure themselves, they have feelings of guilt about their addiction). The fourth factor (5.2% of the variance) is occupied by the empathic attitude items, which have a negative loading, which can be understood as a refusal to establish an empathic relationship with them (they feel that nobody likes them, that they are looked down upon, that everybody hates them, they seek oblivion and comfort in alcohol). The fifth factor (4.0% of the variance) is occupied by two negative items that are not as negatively emotionally charged as the items in the first factor (they destroy families, they are unreliable) and two items that attribute personal responsibility for the onset of dependence. Again, there were differences between the groups. Women significantly loaded more heavily on the first factor than men (p = 0.000), similarly, people who abuse alcoholic beverages loaded more heavily on the first factor than alcoholics (p = 0.047), and people with a problematic drinking pattern loaded more heavily on the second factor than people with a neutral attitude towards drinking. The unstructured part of the questionnaire asked for three follow-up thoughts. The first was: ' When I think of a person who is dependent on alcohol, I think of... "", the second: "" When I think of a person dependent on alcohol, I feel ..."". and the third: "" If the alcohol-dependent person were my son, I would ..."". The first question was most frequently answered with family in 15, the second with sadness (11.6), fear (9.2), anxiety (8.3), sympathy (7.1%) and anger (6.5%), and the third with motivation for treatment (37.4%) and help (24.3%). The only statistically significant difference between these responses was in the second thought, where women were more likely to respond that they felt fear in themselves when they were with an alcoholic (p = 0.048). <p/> Discussion <p/> We found many statistically significant differences between the samples, but unfortunately we cannot discuss all of them here. Therefore, we will only highlight the most pronounced and surprising ones. Our hypothesis that the self-stigmatisation of alcoholics is greater than the stigmatisation of people who are not problem drinkers has been shown to be false. It was influenced by our own narrow social perceptions, when the authors, as therapists in constant contact with sober alcoholics in the therapeutic process, seemed to have gradually lost our own prejudices against these people and inferred from them the perceptions of the general population. Thus, people who harm alcoholics label alcoholics more negatively and lack empathy towards them, which is understood as using their own defences in terms of projection and denial. They see in addicts their own path to alcoholism, their own projection into a future that they hate because they feel powerless to change that path. When they evaluate them, they are in a sense evaluating themselves. However, they, along with the addicts, still showed more leniency towards the alcohol-dependent than people with a neutral attitude towards alcohol, and they were significantly more likely to label alcoholics as bad guys. There was an even clearer difference between people with an alcoholic identity and those without. The former showed much more empathy towards alcoholics, while those without showed significantly more negative social perceptions and prejudices. Factor analysis confirmed these results. People who abuse alcoholic beverages loaded more heavily on the factor with negative items than alcoholics, and the same for women, among whom there is less problematic consumption of alcoholic beverages. On the other hand, people with a problematic attitude towards alcohol loaded more heavily on the factor with positive items than people without a drinking problem. An interesting result is provided by comparing people with an alcoholic identity: those in treatment for up to six months and those in treatment for more than six months. The former significantly loaded more heavily on the first factor than the latter, indicating the influence of the treatment process in terms of alleviating prejudice and abandoning defensive attitudes: by accepting the identity of a treated alcoholic, they have less need to project negative self-images onto ""other"" alcoholics. Our second hypothesis was that relatives would have fewer prejudices against alcoholics than people without this experience. This hypothesis also proved to have no real basis in the sample comparison. The only differences between the two samples were that people without this experience prefer to avoid alcoholics rather than those with it, as evidenced by the sad experience in our Alcoholism Treatment Dispensary of seeing patients who repeat over and over again the well-established, albeit highly pathological and painful, life experiences of living with alcoholics, and that relatives of alcoholics are more likely to see alcoholism as a hereditary disease compared to people without this experience. This difference is probably due to the fact that many of the relatives have been involved in our treatment programmes and that many of the alcoholics in our programmes have had an alcoholic as a relative, so that through the education of the addicts and their relatives, this perception has settled in. The gender differences were interesting. On the one hand, women were typically more likely to have negative social perceptions of alcoholics, but at the same time showed more empathic perceptions towards them. The first part can be understood as a consequence of the fact that women are less likely to be alcohol dependent than men,10 which confirms the aforementioned fact that our hypothesis of greater self-stigmatisation was not supported by the evidence. The second part can be seen as a consequence of women's greater social orientation towards empathic perception of other people.11 For men, the responses were in the opposite direction: they showed a greater defensiveness towards (their own) addiction and a lack of empathic perception of alcoholics. Here we also encounter gendered social perceptions of how alcohol consumption is perceived by men and women, what are acceptable levels and forms of drunkenness. And here we meet strict women, guardians of the family order, peace and the nest, guardians of the circumstances in which children grow up and of family traditions. It is no coincidence that, alongside priests, teachers and doctors, it is women who have helped to build the anti-alcohol movement so enthusiastically, and who have constituted the majority of the membership of these movements.12, 13 Differences according to age have shown a trend towards increasing negative perceptions and prejudices, as well as positive perceptions of alcoholics, with a pronounced defensiveness. It can be concluded that at a younger age attitudes towards alcohol consumption are still relatively neutral, but as the years go by, due to the gradual accumulation of personal experience, more extreme views on addiction grow, both condemnation on the one hand and greater tolerance due to, we assume, a more defensive attitude due to one's own problematic attitude towards alcoholic beverages. Part of these differences can probably be attributed to the fact that first contact with alcoholic beverages is associated with a number of positive effects (validation and acceptance in the society of young people, alcohol as a help and as an alibi for social inadequacies). Negative social perceptions and prejudices correlate even more strongly with educational structure: negative perceptions are highest in the lowest educated group, but so are positive perceptions, presumably due to a higher level of own problematic attitudes towards drinking (alcoholics from the same background have a lower educational level than people from the general population14). On the other hand, higher educated people have a higher level of empathic perception of addicts. <p/> Annex: Questionnaire on perceptions of alcohol dependence <p/> Gender <p/> Age <p/> years. <p/> Education: <p/> incomplete primary school, primary school, vocational secondary school, secondary school, college, university. <p/> On a scale of 1 to 5, please indicate the number that best corresponds to your feelings: <p/> 1 - do not agree at all, 5 - strongly agree. <p/> 1. <p/> Everyone has a reason for getting drunk: social worries, work, family. <p/> 1 <p/> 2 <p/> 3 <p/> YES <p/> NO <p/> - <p/> Do you drink alcoholic beverages practically every day? <p/> YES <p/> NO <p/> Conclusions <p/> Our research has shown an alarming stigmatisation of alcoholics in our cultural environment. Thus, the factor with the highest factor loadings was the factor with negative perceptions of alcoholics, which explained 19.2% of the variance in the factor analysis. Otherwise, the study pointed to large gender, age and educational differences, which we had not expected. Thus, the authors were forced to change our own perceptions of how the wider social environment views alcoholism and the alcoholic. We believed that the environment was much more accepting of alcoholics and often interpreted alcoholics' fear of stigmatisation as an application of their own projections. We have now found that alcoholics' fears of wider social stigma are justified. Especially in the segment of the less educated and women. At this point, we can pause to ask whether the task of therapists working on alcohol dependence is also to change social perceptions of alcoholism. Where there is a lack of knowledge and knowledge, there is room for prejudice and stigmatisation, which is a natural social process. By changing social perceptions and destigmatisation, the authors suggest, social rehabilitation of alcoholics will have greater success and the prognosis for abstinence will be better. Because at present, sober alcoholics are generally more stigmatised after treatment than drunk alcoholics without an alcoholic identity.",Research Article

"Backstories <p/> Interesting facts from the field <p/> Personally, I am very fond of consecutive interpreting ""on the ground"". This is done on various missions, as we call them in the jargon, or visits by inspectors for various areas, such as agriculture, veterinary, EU funds and so on. Such interpretation is quite different from working in interpreting booths, for example, where seemingly trivial paragraphs of European legislation are discussed all day long. On the ground, it is primarily the implementation of this legislation that is being determined. Only then do we have the opportunity to see that the provisions of this legislation must also be observed and implemented by concrete people, and what difficulties this can cause. Such interpretation requires not only special preparation in terms of content, but also special equipment. For example, in agricultural inspections, gojzars or rubber boots, jeans and anorak are part of the compulsory equipment, as we also interpret in stables, on grazing land and in orchards, between cows and chickens, on upland farms and small family cheese dairies, etc. We also interpret in stables, on grazing land and in orchards, between cows and chickens, on upland farms and small family cheese dairies, etc. <p/> Best interpreting experience? <p/> The best experiences are those in which you become part of a team, especially when you interpret for several days or a whole week in a row in the same team. The dynamics of this kind of collaboration are interesting: from the initial ""guessing"" of who is who, to not even saying goodbye to your team at the end. At the beginning, there is often a slight sense of mistrust, like how are you going to be able to understand and even translate our professional content? Over time, participants ""relax"" as they realise that we interpreters not only understand what they are talking about, but are also able to translate complex professional content competently into another language. <p/> Interesting facts from the field <p/> We sometimes work with ""beneficiaries"" of agricultural payments to determine whether the ""competent authorities"" are assessing the land properly, including through the method of re-survey. This looks like a field being measured by a representative of our competent authority, followed by an EU inspector, followed by an interpreter with the obligatory notepad and pencil in hand. Then it starts to rain, and the real art is to stand in the soggy field, holding an umbrella and a notepad, writing down what you hear and then interpreting appropriately and loudly enough. Quite a field ""multi-tasking"", no less. <p/> Most unpleasant interpreting experience? <p/> On one occasion interpreting in court, back in the days when I still wore tight skirts and heels, I discreetly sneak out of the courtroom on minus two decibels and when I return, just as discreetly, I spot a jogger on the smooth parquet floor and... swish, I fold myself as long and wide as I am, the courtroom is flooded with a choral ahhhhh, and I'm already standing and disappearing into the cramped editing booth. Oops. It's embarrassing when a speaker is evasive in his speech or answer, using a thousand masks to hide the fact that he has nothing to say ... and then you have to paint over that ""big nothing"". <p/> Why did you choose to become an interpreter? Has it lived up to your expectations? <p/> The choice of profession came about as a result of a pragmatic decision to put into practice one of the talents that I had been given. I had no expectations when I chose the profession, but it has exceeded my expectations of where it could take me and what it could enable me to do. The decision was made after I read an article about the profession, which inspired me, and I immediately started researching where it was possible to study. The profession met my expectations and I have never regretted my choice. <p/> What should an interpreter be like and what should an interpreter never do in the booth? <p/> Above all, an interpreter should be professional. He or she should be aware of his or her role, prepare for the job, be discreet, impartial, polite, and take for granted the confidentiality of the information obtained. He should be collegial in the cubicle, undisturbing to colleagues. Whatever the situation, whatever the complexity of the work and whatever the content of the interpretation, he should remain calm and collected - which, to be honest, is sometimes easier said than done ... <p/> What about interpreters' quips? <p/> Protesters like to turn into protesters in the interpreter's haste. Handel mit weißer Ware quickly becomes a white-goods trade. When interpreting from English, we like to become avid fans of sexual transformation: we announce Mrs X, and a statuesque gentleman in a polka-dot suit stands up and speaks in a shamelessly beautiful baritone, or we announce Mr Y, and it's no surprise that a plump young woman with a plunging neckline squeals... yes, we interpreters are very innovative. <p/> Speakers' quips when (not) using interpreters or why are interpreters important? <p/> During her presidency, one high-ranking official insisted on speaking English herself at high-profile protocol events, despite not having the best command of the English language and the obvious presence of interpreters. She constantly referred to the European Union as the ""European Onion"". Needless to say, 'European Onion' appears in almost every other sentence during the Presidency. <p/> What do you consider to be the advantages and/or disadvantages of the interpreting profession? <p/> I see the advantages of interpreting mainly in the possibility of continuous learning, the changing working environment both in terms of space and people, which keeps one fresh, but at the same time gives one a good old philosophical thought, which, of course, did not grow on my own lawn, but which I like to use: I know that I know nothing: I know that I do not know anything. I can deduce the weaknesses from the last thought, because you can never know for sure that you have mastered the subject. Another weakness could be found in the variability of the environment, which can contribute to a lack of intensity in personal relationships. <p/> Disclaimer: The photographs illustrate different interpretive situations and are not related to the content of the specific texts.

"Severe consequences <p/> Phuket... a well-known island all over the world. It attracts a lot of tourists from all over.It reminds me a bit of Zakynthos except that it is bigger and of course has bigger and nicer beaches. <p/> On arrival at the airport we booked a hotel in Patong Beach. We rented motorbikes and this is where our exploration of the island began. <p/> TRAFFIC In Thailand, traffic is on the left (as in England). We had rented a car earlier when we were in the north. At first, my father had problems driving. The steering wheel is on the right hand side and then everything else gets confused. When he wanted to turn on the indicator he turned on the windscreen wipers instead. Luckily we took the automatic, otherwise he would have had problems with the gearshift, because he was repeatedly looking for the lever on the right side, where the door was. <p/> I am quite an experienced ""motorcyclist"" myself. I've been driving my scooter around for about 4 years, so I took over as driver and drove my mum around. I thought that driving on the left side would be a bit of a hassle, but I got used to it quickly. I had more trouble parking in the garage.Almost everybody here drives motorbikes and then, of course, they have special garages for motorbikes. Other road users also gave me a bit more trouble. People overtake here on the left and right, sometimes elsewhere if they can. There are no rules, so you really have to be alert and careful for your own safety. <p/> SUN After a short sightseeing tour of the island, swimming followed. Almost all the beaches here are sandy and more crowded with sunbeds, umbrellas, etc. When you want to have a nice rest, there are already vendors from the ""shanties"" selling all kinds of things on the beach (watches, food, clothes... ). After a rest and a swim, we drove to a shopping centre a little further away. It was already really hot outside so I couldn't wait to see the cold shops. Trying on clothes in the mirror, I was surprised by the bright red colour of my hands, just like tomatoes. The sun was burning me badly. I must admit that I didn't put on much sunblock. My skin is naturally darker and I have a lot of pigment. As soon as the sunny days start I get a nice tan. I don't like to sunbathe and I know it's not healthy. I have never had problems with sunburn and that is why I am much more surprised. <p/> I was burnt on my arms (mainly because of the motorbike), shoulders, knees and of course the bottom of my legs.

Aloe Vera and menthol rubs, as well as after-sun creams and compresses, helped my recovery. Today I am much better and even the red colour has changed to a nicer, more tanned brown. <p/> From now on I will not go anywhere without sun cream and I will apply it much more often, because I am risking my life.

"Merkel would agree to minimum wage <p/> Berlin, 21 November (STA) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel today signalled that Germany is on the verge of introducing a minimum wage.

Her CDU, however, opposed such a move and the Chancellor insists that she and her party "" will try to do everything to prevent job losses "" as a result of this measure. <p/> The CDU believes that the minimum wage should be non-binding and limited to specific industries or regions, while the SPD insists on the introduction of a universal minimum wage of €8.5 per hour. <p/> Otherwise, the issues of dual citizenship and homosexual rights remain among the more contentious sticking points in the negotiations. Merkel insists that a deal is possible. ""We will see in the next few days if we succeed. ""According to the Chancellor, the coalition treaty should stand next Wednesday. <p/> According to the negotiators, there are still more than 100 policy areas open. It has even gone so far that CDU representatives have started mentioning new early elections. <p/> Today, after several meetings in small working groups, the negotiators of the three parties will meet for a seventh round of talks in a large group. They will discuss financial and health policy. They are also expected to touch on integration, with a deal on dual citizenship unlikely to be reached today. <p/> If the negotiations with the SPD are successful, Germany will be led by a grand coalition for the third time since the Second World War. In 2005, negotiations on the formation of a coalition government lasted 65 days. <p/> But even if the negotiations are successful, there is one more hurdle to overcome. According to the SPD's statutes, it is up to all of the party's 470,000 or so members, many of whom are not in favour of a coalition with Merkel, to decide whether to join a coalition. In 2009, after four years in Chancellor Merkel's government, the Social Democrats had their worst ever election result.",News

"Funeral vehicles <p/> 01/11/2013 <p/> Andrej Godeša Photo and sources.<p/> Some people go to heaven after death, others at least want to go to outer space <p/> People have always believed in an afterlife. In preparation for their final journey, they once prepared a more or less lavish journey depending on their status in society and the extent of their wealth. Often, so many grave goods were accumulated that a means of transport was used for the final journey, especially if the distance to the resting place was somewhat greater. The tradition has survived almost unchanged to the present day. People plan their final journey using a wide variety of means of transport. <p/> Funeral rituals have of course changed over the millennia, but the essence has remained the same. Human remains had to be buried, burned, immersed or otherwise disposed of. Both out of respect for the dead and the belief that the grave is only a way station on the road to eternity, and for purely practical reasons. By removing the corpse, they prevented beasts from coming near the dwellings, and they removed the source of the unpleasant stench of putrefaction and the risk of spreading infectious diseases. As human society evolved, status symbols soon appeared. Even after death, the high-ranking did not want to give them up, as best evidenced by the building of the pyramids. Rulers were escorted to their final resting place in ornate stretchers, chariots or ships. They were stocked with everything necessary for the mighty to live in the next life. In 323 BC, a funeral chariot with the first simple buffers was used to transport the golden sarcophagus containing the remains of Alexander the Great to Alexandria. Handcarts and horse-drawn carts became the main funerary vehicle for the next few millennia. After the invention of cannons in the 13th century and their gradual increase in size, a variation of this transport became the cannon laffete, a wheeled base for carrying cannons, on which the coffins of military leaders and officers were placed. It was only in the 19th century, with the introduction of the steam engine and the building of railways, that the body of the deceased was occasionally carried by train, while carriages continued to rule the short distances. In some large American cities, special subway cars were built for this purpose, but they did not ""catch on"". Perhaps the world's most famous rail journey was in 1865, when a steam train was used to transport US President Abraham Lincoln on his last journey from Washington, where he was assassinated. The body of the great leader who united Americans divided by the Civil War and abolished slavery was transported by a mourning train through several states to Illinois, where he was buried in a tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery. Closer to us in time and place is the final journey of former Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito, who was transported by train from Ljubljana, where he died in 1980, across much of Yugoslavia to Belgrade, where he is buried in a tomb at Dedinje. With the invention of the electric motor, the internal combustion engine and the automobile, new possibilities emerged for transporting the coffin from the deceased's home or hospital to the mortuary and on to the church, where a farewell service was held, and then on the final journey to the grave. It took almost half a century before motorised hearses became established, before engines became sufficiently powerful and, above all, reliable and quiet. The first mention of motorised hearses dates back to 1907, when a hearse with a built-in electric motor was introduced in Paris. Two years later, a petrol-engined hearse was built in the USA, but it was not until the 1920s that it became widely used. In the first period, especially during the First World War, the same vehicles were used for transporting the wounded and sick as well as for transporting bodies, but almost everywhere the basic purpose of the vehicle was soon separated by the choice of equipment fitted. In some rural areas of the USA, such combination vehicles were still in use in the second half of the last century. Because of the lower frequency of funeral transport, the vehicle was used as an ambulance to transport the wounded, and for the transport of the dead, the vehicle was decorated with curtains and flowers and other decorations before the journey and the vehicle was done. It was not until 1979 that such combinations were banned by US federal law. Most of the vehicles used for funerals are prestigious makes. This way, the deceased gets to ride in a luxury vehicle at least once (if not for life) after death. Maybe they use prestigious vehicles for this purpose more because of the relatives who would be embarrassed if the coffin was driven in a cheap car. In Europe, the most common funeral vehicles today are those based on Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Opel, Ford and, of course, in some places the legendary Rolls Royce or Daimler, while in the USA Cadillac and Lincoln are the leading models, and in Asia Mitsubishi, Toyota and Nissan. The production of hearse vehicles usually takes place in two phases. First, the chassis with the engine and the front section with the driving compartment are mass-produced in the factory, then the vehicle is finished by specialised coachbuilders who slightly reinforce the chassis and the brakes and equip the vehicle according to the wishes and fantasies of the final customer, the funeral company. Today, most funeral vehicles are made by converting station wagons from standard vehicles. Given the ""light work"" involved, these vehicles can last for decades with regular maintenance, so that specialist companies replace them more out of prestige than out of necessity. A few main styles of funeral vehicle fitting have become established around the world. These are usually the classical approach, which has survived from the carriages, which were richly upholstered with plush and curtains, or the limousine approach, where the vehicles are fitted with as many ornate glass surfaces as possible, which are inserted between the supporting pillars. In some parts of Asia, funeral vehicles try to emulate as closely as possible the classical forms of Buddhist temples, decorated with ornate, often gilded, decoration. More recently, in the desire for individuality and originality, some funeral companies have started to use more unusual combinations of vehicles for their clients' final journeys. In the UK, keen motorcyclists may choose a motorcycle with a sidecar to carry the coffin or the urn with the ashes on the final journey. They have come up with something similar with a tricycle and trailer. For those who are in a particular hurry to get to heaven (or more likely hell), they have produced a ""hot rod"" vehicle across the puddle with the symbolic number ""666"" on the door. In some parts of the world, boats are still used for funerals. At the turn of the 21st century, another wish of science and technology lovers has come true, and at the same time we have a new funeral vehicle - the space rocket. In the spring of 1997, the Pegasus rocket flew, carrying the ashes of 24 people who wanted to be astronauts, at least after death, and who could afford it, on its journey into space. The modified rocket, with lipstick-sized grills, orbited the Earth in an elliptical orbit for the next five years until it fell back in spring 2002. Among the ""passengers"" were Gene Roddenberry, screenwriter of the science-fiction film series ""Star Trek"", and Timothy Leary, a psychologist and futurist, best known for his ideas on the therapeutic effects of the drug LSD in the early 1960s. The next flight was the first real space funeral. The ""Lunar Prospector"" probe, which carried not only instruments but also a sample of the famous astronomer's ashes, landed on the Moon. Eugene Shoemaker (discoverer of the comet of the same name), the first man to be buried on the Moon, arrived there in the summer of 1999. In the following years, the death rocket flew several more times and has carried the remains of some 660 people into space to date. Among them are several famous people, such as astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the planet Pluto in the 1930s, James Doohan, better known as Scotty in the ""Star Trek"" film series, and Leroy Gordon Cooper, a member of the first US space expedition (Project Mercury) in the early 1960s.",Information/Explanation

"In the study, scientists from the University of Paraná in Brazil compared the genetic make-up of 90 married couples and compared it to the genetic make-up of 152 randomly selected couples who were a control group.

Scientists don't currently know which traits attract people who are genetically different from them - body odour or facial shape or structure have been suggested as possible reasons. <p/> While it is impossible for people to choose their partners solely on the basis of a rational criterion such as the diversity of their genetic make-up, we do not yet know how this scientific discovery will affect future generations.",News
"Text taken from the novel Three Reasons, page 220. The computer displays images inaudibly and lights flash on the titanium case. Where the light burns long at night, there are ideas. And that, we know, is wrong, heretical ... and dangerous ... <p/> There are no powerful plots in the novel, and it is nothing like The Da Vinci Code, I say to those who, like the writer, had trouble with that book and barely made it to the end. There is a chronological account of the various events in The Three Reasons. It is more like this. And in fact, in film, if you like, and literature, there are few things as dramatic as real life. Even though we all know life, it still tells us something new and special every day. And it is always more interesting to write about. The novel Three Reasons is a humorous slice of a year in the life of a mother of two Lilliputians, a wife and an interesting young woman. <p/> The story introduces different people through a first-person narrative (Xenia's). The negative Vlasta, the careerist Darja, the smeared Nika and the unhappy Veronika, Xenia's family and a wider circle of acquaintances through whom she paints her unusual images. Unlike many other authors, she takes refuge in reality at critical points, or so I understood her. This is very unusual. The author does not come across as naïve at all, I would rather say fresh and youthful. Despite her experience, she has, in my opinion, almost too much confidence in her environment and in other people. How damn wrong she is, she is yet to find out. Her whole generation will find that out. There can be no doubt about that. She is only distrustful of her partner, who probably of all people loves and respects her the most. That does not surprise me one bit. All the women I know are like that. <p/> Without a single exception. :) <p/> There is humour in Three Reasons, too. Good and beautifully written. We can laugh at Alexandra in many places. I found myself laughing the most when she describes the passionate lovemaking where Xenia and Marko have earned their butts on their heads on the same shelf. They switched positions, there is no doubt about that. Whether it was when her phone fell into a puddle or when she met her boyfriend from the machine. <p/> This is how she describes her weighing and makes fun of the fashion commandments. With the rarely seen self-irony of a woman with a slightly damaged self-esteem, which at the end very smoothly turns into a sympathetic sarcasm: <p/> I stripped naked to make the result as accurate as possible. I went to pee earlier, so that I wouldn't suffer at the expense of a few unnecessary grams. And then the fatal step. The thin plate seemed to be groaning under my weight. I blinked, told myself once again that the result didn't matter because I'd fix it soon anyway, then opened my eyes and looked down. 69 kilos. The dreaded seven was damn close. My stomach clenched, I immediately got down and then stepped on the scales again. Don't ever do that unless you're too skinny! I jumped down like I'd been burnt by nettles and resisted the instinctive urge to try again - maybe the result would be more normal after all, like a cute 62. It was clear that the scale was sensing my torment and deliberately adding salt to my tired bones. <p/> Through self-irony, she also makes a rueful mockery of a world in which Barbies are the ideal of feminine beauty, and things like that. <p/> Those Barbies you can talk to like you can talk to the telly ... :) <p/> 3. <p/> Language is special. It's self-described and not inspired by anyone. It's a little bit like Gosposvetsko polje, it's just more modern and quite unusual. It is apparent that Aleksandra also writes poetry, quite well, in the opinion of those in the know, to put it casually. The language is innovative in describing contemporary things and interspersed with less familiar words for decoration and delicacy. Sometimes even too much, even with paediatric and other medical terms. I did not understand it yet, but I studied medicine. Don't believe me? I really did, only that was a long time ago, when I was in the seventh grade of an eight-year school. Even then I was very talented, although not much appreciated, and only one classmate had any understanding for my studies. I read the medical encyclopaedia, all the entries on A and B. And I had the symptoms of all those diseases. Except for white current, or I didn't know how to recognise it in the first year. So I dropped out of that study. For health reasons, mostly. :) The structure of the text itself is also quite strange. The beginning and the end of the novel are symmetrical, the same words are repeated. The mantra of the three reasons appears throughout the text, which is why it's like a kind of theme or a literary musical theme. There are other structural and stylistic elements, but they are not the most essential for an amateur's experience and understanding of the content. That is why I leave them to the experts, so that they have something to write about. <p/> It is quite a good text. Will it win any prizes? I am thinking. Hardly. Just because it is written by a young woman, it doesn't stand much of a chance. Although ... Still, there's something going on with these awards. Something heretical. Something they're stirring up over there now, bossing and changing. That's good. At least that's what I was thinking on the Rožnik, listening to the cute Combine singing a song. The lyrics were written by Moss, in case you didn't know. That Vojnović gets more votes than Jančar? That is something! For Vojnović, of course. A little less for Jančar. That is heretical and different from what it was. So that the faces in the boxes sometimes get mixed up. That is also the point. To have something fresh for the daily news and not just last year's news. I have not read these two books to this day. I have no time. Except for a little bit in the sublist. If anything, I prefer to read Lainsztek and Mazzini. Or poetry, if I don't have anything more clever to do. <p/> For all these reasons, I hope that Alexandra has a chance with Three Reasons. She could do with some kind of prize, probably more than the aforementioned authors. And no one would be too much of a fool. They wouldn't have anything to bullshit about, at least in my opinion. There are more than three reasons for that, too. And her thirtieth anniversary is coming up soon, because she's in quite a hurry. Already at the age of four ... :) <p/> I would also like to draw attention to a particular atmosphere that emanates from the text. It seems Bulgakovian to me, although I can't explain it very well. There are no communist apparatchiks, and nobody's head is cut off by a tram. But there is something there, if not I would not feel it. Only, I cannot say it very well, because I am just a lover of literature and I am writing my opinion here mainly for you to pick up the book. <p/> That is all it is really about.",Review

"Yesterday's news from the municipality about the dismissal of two vice-mayors is still reverberating around Ravenna. It is likely that the Mayor's decision was also the result of public pressure. One of these was published in Dnevnik 3 days ago, where Mojca gave a detailed description of the situation in the municipality and its staffing, which is very true. Mojca Marot's article is published in full. <p/> In Ravenna, more and more people are dissatisfied with the staffing of the SDS mayor Tomaž Roženo, as they have loudly and clearly pointed out at the recent protests. ""We have had enough of clientelism and nepotism, of immoral and unethical moves by our mayor,"" was one of the slogans at the only protest in Carinthia so far, which took place in Ravenna. After we wrote about the functions and remuneration that vice-mayors receive for their work across Slovenia, and highlighted the outcry from young Social Democrats in Ravne, several people from Carinthia who attended the recent protest drew our attention to this slogan, which was lost in the crowd. <p/> The two vice-mayors are brother-in-law and sister-in-law <p/> In a recent article, we mentioned that many people feel that three vice-mayors in Ravenna are too many for the municipality, given its size and the professionalism of Mayor Tomaž Roženo, and that they are also costing the municipal budget a lot. Rožžen assured us that he does not intend to give up any of them, as he believes they are crucial for consensus in the municipal council. But many consider this statement to be far-fetched. Two of them, Milan Škafar and Vera Krajnc, as Ravenč citizens have pointed out to us, are in any case members of his SDS party and, incidentally, they are also related to each other. Kranjc is said to be the sister of Škafar's wife, which means that they are brother-in-law and sister-in-law, while the third deputy mayor, Peter Oder, who runs the Eurosplet company (the Carinthian Student Service, which he and Rozen founded in 1999), is also a ""mayor's"" cadre. According to the Supervizor website, more than €3.6 million has flowed into this company from various public institutions over the last ten years, but the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption concludes that there have been no irregularities. In any case, the 22-member municipal council of Ružen is made up of 10 SDS party representatives, and if we take into account all those who belong to the so-called coalition, it is clear that Ružen does not need a consensus at all. <p/> Not political framing, but a reward for good work? <p/> ""His actions are immoral and unethical, to say the least, and the main concern of both the mayor and the councillors is that they are appointing people loyal to their political option to key positions, i.e. to management positions in public institutions. Half of their relatives have already got a job this way,"" the people of Ravenč are angry. They are particularly surprised by the reincarnation of the Vice-Mayor Škafar, who is in charge of municipal affairs, but otherwise works for Metal in Ravenna. Some time ago, even his own party reportedly demanded that he be expelled and removed from all public office, but now he is once again a member of the SDS party's executive committee. Incidentally, shortly after the local elections, passions were already running high on this issue at one of the municipal councils in Ravenna. SD councillor Zlatko Halilovič raised his voice against the appointment of three vice-mayors. ""We don't need three vice-mayors, unless it's political spoils for the SDS party,"" he said at the time, adding that councillors are accountable to all citizens, not just to the SDS party. <p/> SDS monopoly in public institutions <p/> The debate became even more heated when it came to appointing members to the boards of public institutions and companies, where Halilovič was joined by a few other supporters in protesting that they were dominated by SDS members. ""Are you going to change the law of physics so that one being can be in several places at the same time? Nine parties have made it to the council, not just SDS, so it is right to balance things"", Halilovic said at the time, referring to the apparent clientelism. The mayor and Krajnčeva dismissed the accusations, saying that just because someone is related to someone else does not mean that they do not have the right to be elected or delegated to an institution's council, moreover, it is a reward for good work, which was apparently also recognised by the voters. Yet it is strange that 23 of the 53 seats, almost half, on the boards of public institutions and companies are held by SDS members, some of whom have even been appointed to several boards at the same time. Robert Brezovnik and Dušan Dretnik also pointed this out, but were overruled by other members of the Elections and Appointments Commission. Surprisingly, even SDS councillor Enriko Plevnik was self-critical in the debate at the time. He said that ""the list is really strange"", while the Mayor said that the seats were distributed in proportion to the election results. These days, however, many people in Ravenna are very interested in who will occupy the director's chair of the Institute for Sport. The current first man of this institution, Aleksander Kotnik, also a councillor of the SDS in Ravenna, is moving to the helm of the music school. <p/> People are also wondering about the reincarnation of Milan Škafar, the Deputy Mayor, who is in charge of municipal affairs, but otherwise works for Metal in Ravenna. Some time ago, even his SDS party reportedly demanded that he be expelled and removed from all public office, but now he is again a member of the party's executive committee. <p/> One of the vice-mayors, Peter Oder, who is also a director of Eurosplet, d. o. o., - Koroški Student Services, refused to comment on yesterday's decision. However, he was disturbed by Saturday's article, in which we wrote that, according to the Supervizor website, €3.6 million had been transferred from various public institutions to Eurosplet - Koroški Student Services over the last ten years. In his view, this figure is misleading and casts him and the Mayor in a bad light. ""Of this amount, approximately €2.84 million represents direct earnings of students. However, the recognised costs to Eurosplet over ten years amounted to only €128,000 or €12,800,"" explains Oder. He adds that around two thirds of the income generated by public institutions is generated outside the municipality of Ravne, while the recognised costs of doing business with all public institutions in the municipality average just €4,300 per year.",Opinion/Argumentation

"Organise your life <p/> Spring is a time of awakening, renewal and regeneration, of cleaning up old sins and starting new ones. Make new beginnings also in the organisation of your life. <p/> Stress at work, family commitments, the general fast pace of life are not only tiring but can cause anxiety and general restlessness. Sometimes we feel that we will not be able to do even one of them because of the pile of commitments, our minds wandering from one to the other, unable to concentrate at all and thinking about which is more important. <p/> As spring slowly arrives, it is a good time to rethink life's priorities and try to organise our lives better. <p/> One of the world's most renowned systems of organisation and productivity improvement or time management was defined by David Allen in his book Getting Things Done. In the following sections, we guide you through the basics of organisation that will help you to systematise your life's habits and commitments so that you start to enjoy them. <p/> 1. Gather your thoughts <p/> First, it is important to find the best ways to gather all the information and thoughts that otherwise run through your head during the day. You know: smart people write! Don't try to remember all the information, schedules or ideas that pop into your head. Instead, carry a notebook with you at all times, wherever you go, and write down everything that comes to mind. <p/> Process the information. After you have collected your thoughts in your own way, process them. Start at the beginning - identify what is most important and what is what you don't need. Make decisions quickly and don't delay. Be ruthless and get rid of all the ballast, both in terms of stuff and information. Only delay tasks if you know they require more than two minutes of your time. In this case, put each task on a list, archive it, but get on with it as soon as time permits. Plan <p/> 2. Plan <p/> At the beginning of each week, on Monday morning or even on Sunday evening, decide on one to three most important goals and put them in your weekly schedule. These should be major tasks that - when completed - will make you feel proud. Similarly, divide each day into smaller tasks. From a psychological point of view, it is best to do the most important tasks in the morning, as this will take most of the burden off your shoulders when the day is just getting off to a good start. Make your scheduling system as easy to use and understand as possible - there is no need to waste time familiarising yourself with Outlook or other software on your computer. <p/> 3. Focus <p/> We all know that it is difficult to do every task with complete focus and without interruptions. But this is one of the most basic habits you need to learn, as it ensures good time management. Exclude all possible distractions: e-mail, mobile phones and, if necessary, the Internet. <p/> This way of working may not be so easy if you have a distaste for a particular task. In this case, first consider the positive aspects of the task. For example, it may lead to a new project, a promotion to a better job, or you may just learn something new and interesting. Then break the task into mini-tasks, each of which will take you no more than five minutes. Once you've done the first one, we guarantee the others will flow like clockwork. Reward yourself by completing the first three or four mini-tasks - for example, by reading an email or web portal for five minutes. Then get on with the job. <p/> 4. Organise your work and living space <p/> The perception of being stifled by commitments can also be influenced by the messiness of the environment in which we live and work. Spring is a good time to start reorganising our living and working environment and putting all the things that surround us on a daily basis in their place. First, define a system to store similar things together (e.g. bills, documents). Even if some of us work well in functional clutter, it is systematised for the individual, we just have to find a (dis)order that suits us. Then follow the system, give each item a proper place and start keeping all the related items in a real-time storage. <p/> 5. Review <p/> Regularly review both the newly established storage system and your progress in terms of meeting your objectives. Review your notes and draw a line at the end of the week to assess how well you have done in meeting your commitments. This is important to reaffirm success to yourself or to learn from your mistakes in the future. After the review, set yourself tasks and goals for the coming week based on your past shortcomings and the things you failed to tick off the list. Focus on the most important ones or simplify the ones that are not the most urgent. <p/> 6. Find your passion <p/> Do those things that you really enjoy, that - even if they are professional in nature - you enjoy and that you feel you could enjoy for the rest of your life. The fact that finding the perfect job is difficult is an understatement. But it is worth finding, and we recommend that you never give up the search. Think how easy it would be to do the tasks listed above if they were related to an activity or topic that you are passionate about! If you can't turn your passion into a job, make sure you do something about it, at least in your spare time, because that's how you can regain some confidence or motivation. <p/> Finally, it is important to create your own comfortable routine. Routines are considered by many to be boring and can kill the spirit. To a certain extent this is true, but in times when you are overwhelmed it can make your daily efforts and life in general much easier. It is therefore advisable to develop routines in the area of work habits and patterns - if you make it a part of your blood to collect your thoughts, set goals and plan how to achieve them on a weekly and daily basis, your life will be much easier. <p/> We wish you to enter this spring with focus and determination. <p/> Article by Elvira Leka, translated and edited by Katarina Cvikl.",Instruction

"The history of hunting is as old as mankind. However, like man, the meaning of hunting has changed over time. Today, hunting is no longer a struggle for human survival, but is primarily about protecting nature and preserving wildlife so that we can preserve both for our descendants. <p/> Many people do not understand our mission, so in our LD Fram we have decided to present part of our activities to the people under the slogan Take care of the birds. <p/> So in 2011, we took part in a fair in the courtyard of the castle in the municipality of Rače - Fram with our presentation. Since we have 51 members, we symbolically made just as many bird feeders, for which wood was donated by farmers from our area. They also thought our idea was original and good. Then, with the help of the carpenters in our LD, we made the bird feeders. We also lit our logo on each one to remind the recipients of our charity. Of course, we didn't forget the bird feed we also asked for. <p/> Our LD has hunting horn players who take care of hunting music, which is part of hunting culture, and it was to them that the honour belonged to play the opening melodies and announce the start of the fair. We decorated our stand appropriately, as befits hunters, with our emblem, and we also provided food and drinks. <p/> The response of the visitors was very positive, as the food and feeders ran out quite quickly. We were also pleased, as we made contact with people and introduced them to our mission, our care for nature and wildlife.",News

"Former President Donald Trump addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference held at the Hyatt Regency on 28 February 2021 in Orlando, Florida. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) <p/>His comments were published on Friday on a new online platform he has set up to communicate with his followers. He also branded the 2020 presidential election ""fake"" while passing by both countries. <p/> Writing ""From Donald J. Trump's desk"", he said: ""At 6:31 a.m. on 4 November, 149,772 votes came in in the state of Michigan. Biden received 96% of those votes and the state miraculously went to him. Has the Michigan State Senate already begun its review of the fraudulent 2020 presidential election, or will they begin soon? If not, they would be out of office. Also, at 3.42 a.m., the state of Wisconsin received a dump of 143 379 votes, also miraculously, given to Biden. Where did these 'votes' come from? They were both going to national elections, and that is on top of other corruption, without even including the fact that neither state has received the legislative approval required by the US Constitution. ""<p/>Trump's comments came as the Justice Department expressed concerns about ballot security and potential voter intimidation stemming from a private Republican Senate recount in Arizona if the 2020 presidential election comes to Maricopa County. <p/>The Associated Press reported that in a letter to GOP Senate President Karen Fann, the head of the Justice Department's civil rights division said the Senate, which is from 2.1 million ballots from the state's most populous district to the contractor, could violate a federal law that requires ballots. to remain under the supervision of election officials for 22 months. <p/>And Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Pamela Karlan said the Senate contractor's plans to contact voters directly could constitute illegal voter intimidation. <p/>The Justice Department's letter came six days after voting rights groups urged federal officials to intervene or send observers to the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix at the State Fairgrounds, where ballots are counted. <p/> Trump used his new online platform after he was banned from Twitter, Facebook and other social networks following the attack on the Capitol building on 6 January. <p/> Twitter said Trump was permanently banned from tweeting after the platform said his tweets after the action appeared to support those who engaged in violence that day. <p/> Trump's new page does not currently allow people to comment on his posts.",News

"Gala Event Recording <p/> 05 Aug <p/> Interested in recording a wedding, or maybe just events in general? Everyone has a few events in their life that they would like to remember, whether it's the confirmation of their children, their marriage to their partner, celebrating their father's birthday, a work party or any other celebration. These events can be remembered through photographs, but even better are videos. Nowadays, almost all small devices can record. These recordings are of course satisfactory, but for events such as weddings or something similar, it is better to have a recording team that is professionally involved. <p/> Recording weddings usually takes place from the morning until late in the evening. Usually two cameramen are present at the wedding to record the event from several angles. Filming starts in the morning, with the two cameramen recording the preparations of the bride and groom, the various customs, the wedding in the church and registry office, the entertainment, the dancing and everything else that goes along with it. Filming weddings is not an easy task, the cameramen try to capture as many events as possible while remaining inconspicuous. It's definitely worth every penny, there's a lot of post-production work to be done by the film crew, and you get a finished product and a shot of an event that you'll be able to relive for the rest of your life. <p/> I've only described one example of filming a formal event, a wedding, but as I mentioned at the beginning of this article, anything can be filmed. Although semi-professional equipment is readily available to everyone, it is really the experience that counts. If you want quality footage, hire a professional.

"About the book and the author(s) <p/> The novel interweaves (through the lens of a fictional writer) three stories derived from three autobiographical accounts: the story of a great archaeologist (Heinrich Schliemann), the story of an adventure novelist (Karl May), and the story of a counter-intelligence chief in an ""unnamed country"", set in the second half of the 20th century. The basic link between the narratives is the writer's reflection on the falsity or truthfulness of autobiographies. <p/> The narrative of the counter-intelligence officer is in prose, the individual parts of the archaeologist's story are in verse (hexameter, elegiac distich), and the story of Karl Mayo is accompanied as a theatrical performance. This mixing of genres is inspired, at least in formal terms, by the novels of the Enlightenment (Diderot, Sterne). The work is thus situated in the tradition of the modern novel in the context of world literature, the beginning of which most literary historians place at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries. <p/> The experimentalism of the Enlightenment novel, rediscovered by postmodernism, is realised in In Their Own Words above all as a play with the expressive possibilities of autobiographical writing. (Autobiographicalism is currently, both in Slovenia and worldwide, one of the most topical themes for both creators and researchers of fiction.) In terms of content, the work is open to the outside, but at the same time - through the figure of the writer, as well as through the presence of the implicit reader - it is closely embedded in the Slovenian space. <p/> Katarina Marinčič <p/> Slovenian writer, 1968 <p/> Katarina Marinčič is well known to Slovenian readers, having published three novels, Tereza (1989), Rožni vrt (1992) and Prikrita harmonija (2001), as well as a collection of novellas, O treh (2005). She received the Kresnik Prize (2002) for her novel Prikrita harmonija / Hidden Harmony and the Dnevnik Fable Prize (2007) for her collection O treh / About Three. In 2015, her novel After Their Words earned her a nomination for the K kresnik and the Critics' Sieve Award. <p/> The writer's second - or parallel - profession is also related to literature.

"Ljubljana, 28 November (STA) - The results show that a methodologically adjusted calculation would reduce the internal rate of return of Tesla 6 from 7.59% to 6.91%. Unsubstantiated assumptions allow risks to increase and, if they materialise, the rate could even fall to 5.12 percent, Geert Warringa of CE Delft said today at a presentation of the methodological flaws in the investment programme of Tesh 6. <p/> Such a rate of internal rate of return is far below the nine per cent required by the government in April as a condition for the state guarantee. ""Therefore, the project should not have received state support in the form of a state guarantee,"" pointed out Lidija Živčič of Focus. <p/> The report states that there are some methodological errors in the investment calculations for the construction of the sixth unit of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant (Teš 6). Lignite prices are underestimated, lignite consumption is underestimated from 2028 onwards, and CO2 costs are underestimated because process emissions from desulphurisation plants, which will be auctioned after 2020, are not included. <p/> The programme also assumes that the efficiency of lignite extraction will increase, but this assumption is not justified, the report points out. The result would be undervalued lignite prices. Another unjustified assumption, according to the report, is that the peak electricity produced (1000 GWh) will always be in demand on the international market, Warringa noted. <p/> Ms Živčičeva noted that the report also states that the investment programme does not follow the principles of cost-benefit analysis because no realistic alternative for the investment is given. ""The investment programme neither proves that the investment in unit 6 is the best alternative, which should be supported by a state guarantee and the risk should be borne by the state, nor that Teš 6 is the best alternative for energy supply in Slovenia,"" she said. <p/> Piotr Trzaskowski of the CEE Bankwatch Network pointed out that the involvement of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) in the project is not proof of a reliable economic assessment of the project. He warned that previous Slovenian governments had failed to do their homework and that if the project is granted a state guarantee for the EIB loan, Slovenian taxpayers will pay for their mistakes with their own money. <p/> ""Now that new errors are being revealed in the calculations of the economic bases for Teš 6, the two public European banks have the opportunity to recognise their initial mistake and withdraw from this bad project while they still can. If we add to the errors identified in the report the errors in the procurement of Teš 6, we see that this project has the potential to cause serious damage to the reputation of the EBRD and the EIB,"" Trzaskowski stressed. <p/> The report was commissioned by the environmental organisations CEE Bankwatch Network and Focus, with financial support from the European Climate Foundation, and prepared by the Dutch consultancy CE Delft. <p/> The report will be sent to current and future parliamentarians and government representatives. <p/> The CE Delft report confirms that the Teš 6 project is ""an economically misguided or unjustified investment"", according to Zares Vice President Darja Radić, also a former Minister of the Economy. She recalled that, as a portfolio minister, she had proposed to the government to reject the state guarantee for Teš 6. Among other things, she had stated at the time that the project was economically too risky on key parameters - the price of coal, the price of CO2 credits, the size of the investment and the price of electricity. <p/> As Radićeva also wrote in a press release, the CE Delft report found methodological errors by the investment promoters on the first two parameters: the price of coal and the price of CO2 credits. They conclude that the coal price is underestimated and the cost of CO2 emissions is also underestimated.",News

The youth section will organise other cultural events at local and municipal level. <p/> The first opportunity for young culture lovers to show their skills was the Cultural Festival on 8 February. On Sunday 6 February 2011, in the parish hall of Vojsko, we commemorated the memory of our greatest Slovenian poet, František Prešeren. In a short speech, the poet's life and work were presented in pictures and words. The young theatre students staged his work The Waterman in a special way <p/> On this day, special attention was also paid to the poem Vojsko by Tadeja Vončina, which she wrote for this very occasion.",News

"Case-law: Admissibility of a revision 05.10.2015 According to settled case-law, if the claimant does not state the value of the object at issue for each individual claim, but only states the total value, this is not sufficient for the admissibility of a revision. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the claims that the defendants were obliged to enter into a contract of sale with the plaintiffs, pursuant to which they would sell the property to them and the plaintiffs were obliged to pay the defendants the unpaid part of the purchase price. The applicants also claimed that the defendants were obliged to deliver possession of the property to them and to pay them a monthly fee until delivery. <p/> The Court of First Instance dismissed the applicants' appeal and upheld the judgment under appeal. The applicants lodged an appeal against the final judgment, raising all the grounds of appeal and seeking an amendment of the judgment under appeal to allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of First Instance and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. <p/> The review was not allowed. The applicants brought three claims against the three defendants. The claims for the conclusion of a contract of sale and for the delivery of immovable property are non-monetary claims for which the right to review depends on the value of the subject-matter in dispute. Notwithstanding Article 41(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (CPL), the value of the contested part of a final judgment is to be determined by adding together the values of the individual claims or parts of those claims which are still in dispute, where the decision on the review depends on the resolution of legal issues common to all those claims or where the individual claims are so interrelated that the decision on one claim depends on the decision on another claim (Article 367(5) CPL). However, in the case of the first two claims (for the conclusion of the contract of sale and for the delivery of the immovable property), there is not only an objective cumulation, but also a subjective one. There are three defendants. <p/> Where a claim is brought against several defendants, it is incumbent on the plaintiff, pursuant to Article 41(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, to state the value of the object of the dispute for each defendant individually and not for all the defendants jointly. If the plaintiff fails to do so and in such a case states only one value of the subject-matter in dispute for all defendants together, this is a so-called undifferentiated value of the subject-matter in dispute. <p/> The defendants are not united co-defendants, since they are not in such a substantive community that only the same decision for all three would be possible. Since they are co-owners and can dispose of their co-ownership interest in the immovable property independently, the defendants are ordinary co-defendants within the meaning of Article 191(1)(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, and the aggregation of values under Article 41(1) in conjunction with Article 367(5) of the Civil Procedure Code is therefore not applicable in such a case. <p/> Moreover, the claimants are also ordinary co-claimants, since they claim the conclusion of the contract and delivery of possession each for themselves in accordance with their share of the joint ownership. In view of the co-partnership relationship on both sides, the Supreme Court found that there were six claims, each of which could share a separate legal fate. The admissibility of the revision would therefore be judged on the value of each individual claim. <p/> However, since the applicants did not indicate the value of the subject-matter at issue for each individual claim, but only one, aggregate value (EUR 135,000) was indicated, this is an undifferentiated indication of the value of the subject-matter at issue, which, according to settled case-law, is not sufficient for the admissibility of the revision. It is not possible to determine to which of the claimants and to which of the defendants the total value of the disputed object referred to in the application relates, so that the situation is the same as if the value of the disputed object had not been mentioned at all, which means that the revision is not admissible. Since the value of the pecuniary claim also did not exceed the threshold of EUR 40 000, the review is not admissible in that respect either. In accordance with Article 377 of the CPC, the Court of Review dismissed the unauthorised revision.",Legal/Regulation

"Boris Pahor, writer, fellow-traveller and harsh critic of all three totalitarianisms of the 20th century, visited Kamnik <p/> Kamnik (4.5.2010) - Boris Pahor, writer, academic, Prešeren laureate, Knight of the French Legion of Honour, multiple Nobel Prize nominee, and recent recipient of Austria's highest state decoration, visited Kamnik today, where in front of a packed hall of the Kamnik Parent Library he spoke about his views on Slovenian society in the present and the past, both in his native Slovenia and abroad. His sparkling critical remarks touched everyone, regardless of political or ideological affiliation. In short, despite his 97 years, Boris Pahor is still at the centre of a critical shake-up of our society. <p/> VIDEO: Writer Boris Pahor thanks for the invitation to Kamnik and critically evaluates the arbitration agreement between Slovenia and Croatia. <p/> Short biography <p/> Boris Pahor was born in Trieste on 26 August 1913, and as a child of seven he witnessed the fascist burning of the Narodni dom (National Home), then the central institution of the Slovenes of Trieste, on 13 July 1920, and later witnessed the fascist persecution of the Slovenes, which led him to join the national liberation movement during the Second World War.<p/> Boris Pahor was born in Trieste on 26 August 1913, and as a child of seven he witnessed the Fascist burning of the Narodni dom (National Home), then the central institution of the Slovenes of Trieste, on 13 July 1920. In 1944, he was arrested and sent to the concentration camps of Dachau, Natzweiler-Struthof and Bergen-Belsen, which he survived with resilience and returned to Trieste after receiving treatment in a French sanatorium. After graduating from the University of Padua, he took a job as a teacher at the rebuilt Slovenian school in his hometown. <p/> Outline of his literary work <p/> Boris Pahor is considered one of Europe's best-known Slovenian writers.His works deal with the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps, often touch on the subject of the Slovenian minority in Italy and the suffering of the Slovenes of the Littoral region, and he is also known for his social and political engagement. Among his best-known works are the collection of novellas The City in the Bay and the novels Nomads without an Oasis, Clash with Spring and, above all, Necropolis, which has been translated into several European languages. Boris Pahor's literary works were re-evaluated only after Slovenia's independence, when he was awarded the Prešeren Prize and the Honorary Medal of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia. To this day, however, the writer maintains a critical stance, for example in the controversy over the Italian Day of Remembrance for the post-war killings and the departure of Italians from Istria, accusing Italy of forgetting about fascism, while also criticising Slovenian restraint. <p/> The discussion with the writer Boris Pahor took place under the title ""Witness to the past"" and was moderated by the young writer Mitja Čander. <p/> Boris Pahor: ""The minority should be united in its political speech"" <p/> As a left-wing democrat, the writer Boris Pahor, together with the Catholic writer Alojz Rebula, laid the cultural foundations of the Slovenian minority in Italy after the Second World War. The renewed Slovenian cultural and political life encouraged Pahor to become involved in it by editing magazines such as Zaliv. Throughout, the writer from Trieste maintained a critical distance and view of Slovenian reality, defending his independence of thought, which naturally led him to clashes with the then dominant left-wing component in the Slovenian minority and with the new communist government in Slovenia. Although he himself was politically left-leaning, he never agreed with the position of Slovenians within the Italian left-wing parties, but instead advocated independent political action. <p/> Boris Pahor attracted a very diverse audience. Kamnik has not seen an event in a long time that brought together citizens of such different political and ideological persuasions. <p/> ""The TIGR fighters were the first fighters against fascism"" <p/> Boris Pahor stressed that the members of the TIGR organisation were the first to resist fascism. Their activities were multifaceted, including the collection of arms for a possible anti-Italian uprising in the event of an Italian attack on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Unlike the Communists, however, they were concerned to ensure that their actions caused as few casualties among the Slovene population as possible. When they killed one Italian in an action and this led to the Italians killing four Slovenes in revenge, they realised that such a struggle was not worthwhile. <p/> Pahor also pointed out that the post-war oblates refused to recognise the TIGR, and only recently has the TIGR been gaining ground again. Now, young people are also joining the organisation and are committed to the cause of slovakia. On the other hand, Pahor has repeatedly warned against the sale of Slovenian land in Primorska to the Italians, which would lead to the re-Italianisation of Primorska. He was also very critical of Ljubljana, or central Slovenia, which showed no great interest in Slovenians abroad. In Pahor's opinion, Slovenian school textbooks also do not sufficiently inform young people about the suffering of the Primorje people under fascism. Pahor is also against defending the struggle against the liberation movement as merely a struggle against communism. <p/> Matej Tonin listened attentively to Boris Pahor's thoughts. <p/> ""Slovenia behaves towards its neighbours like a war loser"" <p/> On the one hand, Boris Pahor also regrets the break-up of Yugoslavia, although he has never been against an independent Slovenian state. Slovenia's problem is that it does not have the same power as the former Yugoslavia, but our country's main problem is that it is too humble in its demands on its neighbours when it comes to asserting its national interests and protecting its national community. ""Slovenia is behaving as if it had lost the war, not won it"", Pahor added. <p/> Several books by Boris Pahor were also available for purchase in the foyer of the hall. <p/> ""The post-war massacre of Home Army soldiers - a morally reprehensible act"" <p/> Pahor took the former regime in the former Yugoslavia by storm with the publication of the booklet ""Edvard Kocbek, a Witness of Our Time"", which he and Alojz Rebula wrote in 1975 on the occasion of Kocbek's 70th birthday. In the accompanying interview, Kocbek spoke for the first time about the post-war massacre of returned Slovene Home Army soldiers, which raised a lot of dust, and Pahor was banned from entering the country by the Yugoslav communist authorities. <p/> For Boris Pahor, he is a victim, a victim no matter which political-ideological pole he comes from. That is why, despite the fact that he was taken to a German camp precisely because of his betrayal of the Home Army, he condemns the post-war killings of Home Army soldiers (around 10 000), because they were killings of unarmed prisoners of war. In this context, Boris Pahor advocated that the killings in the fojba, which in recent years have been exploited by Italian nationalists and even the highest representatives of the Italian state, should be placed in the broader context of events and it should be said that there were even bigger abysses in mainland Slovenia, where the communists after the war threw Slovenians - political opponents - and that the fojba should also be seen in the broader historical context of the suffering of the Slovenes of the Littoral region under fascist Italy since 1918 or, in other words, in the period of the Nazi occupation of the territory of the Littoral region. Italy, unlike Germany, which carried out a consistent denazification, did not carry out a de-Fascistisation. <p/> Boris Pahor: ""Communism was a religion, even though it did not recognise God Stalin, in organising this ""Communist Church"", modelled himself on the institutional structure of the Catholic Church: with a Pope, cardinals, bishops and chaplains - of course, by other names.... There are 15 beasts in every man, and if a man lives in a totalitarian system, every such system acquires certain collaborators and believers who are ready to support it with all their being. This could explain the emergence of various leaders, e.g. in our case the ""udbovtsy"", who blindly trusted the Party and, like true believers, believed in communism, without giving a second thought to not deceiving their neighbours... Josip Broz Tito could be considered a criminal by many criteria, but he also has the merit of having Primorska annexed to Yugoslavia and Slovenia."" <p/> Speaking of the Christian socialist Edvard Kocbek, whom he knew well, he said that communism should be realised in Slovenia, on the Christian-socialist foundations that Kocbek envisioned. But because the Slovenian communists had taken a different path, one that restricted freedom of thought and the individual, the communist model ended as it did in failure - and according to Pahor, communism as it was deserved it. <p/> In Pahor's view, Christians and parties that defend Christian values and the welfare state, like Krek and Kocbek, should also participate in any government. Only this, in Pahor's view, can lead to balanced development. <p/> However, the writer was also critical of Christians because, in his opinion, they put too much emphasis on wealth and appearances. In his opinion, it is difficult to become a good Christian from a Catholic ...",News

"international protection - restriction of movement of an applicant for international protection - removal procedure - abuse of procedure - objective criteria - implementation of the Directive <p/> Core <p/> The presumption that an applicant has made an application solely to delay his/her return can be justified on the basis of objective criteria. However, the current ZMZ-1 does not contain such objective criteria, which means that Article 8 of Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on standards for the reception of applicants for international protection has not been fully implemented in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia and, therefore, Article 8 of the Directive is directly applicable in accordance with the principle of primacy. Therefore, since the objective criteria have not been incorporated by the legislator into the ZMZ-1, it is not possible to restrict movement on this legal basis until the ZMZ-1 is amended accordingly. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> I. The action is allowed and the contested decision No 2142-906/2020-6 (1312-02) of 4 June 2020 is annulled. <p/> II. The application for interim measures is dismissed. <By the contested order, the defendant detained the applicant on the ground that his movements were already restricted as a result of the return procedure under the Law on the entry, stay and departure of aliens in the Republic of Slovenia, in order to carry out and enforce the removal procedure, and that it could reasonably be assumed that the applicant had lodged the application only to delay or obstruct the implementation of the removal procedure, when he had the possibility to apply for international protection. It decided that the applicant would be detained at the premises of the Aliens Centre in Postojna from 4 June 2020 from 15.20 until the end of the reason, but no longer than until 4 September 2020 at 15.20, with the possibility of an extension of one month. <p/> 2. In the grounds for the decision, the defendant states that the applicant lodged an application for international protection in the Republic of Slovenia on 4 June 2020. On 2 June 2020, the applicant was released from prison. .... The District Court ... imposed on him, inter alia, the ancillary sanction of expulsion of the alien from the country. As it was not possible to remove the applicant immediately from Slovenia, he was placed by decision of 2 June 2020 in the Aliens Centre, where he expressed his wish to apply for international protection on 3 June 2020, and his application was formally accepted on 4 June 2020. At the time of his application, the applicant stated that he had left his country of origin 4 years previously. He has not yet applied for international protection in Slovenia, but he has applied in Italy, where he holds a passport. He has been in Slovenia since October 2019. The applicant said that he was applying now because he had been in prison, and in prison he did not know that he could apply for international protection. Immediately after his entry into Slovenia, he was caught and put in prison. He was in Italy waiting for a decision on his application for international protection, but in the meantime he made a mistake and went to Slovenia, where he went to prison. He is seeking international protection in Slovenia because he is at risk in Pakistan. <p/> 3. According to the defendant, the condition for restriction of movement laid down in Article 84(3)(1) of the International Protection Act ('the IPA-1') is fulfilled. Given that the applicant had previously applied for international protection also in France and Italy, and then went to his country of origin and married there, and came back to Italy and then to Slovenia, the Court finds that by such actions he prevents any State from taking a substantive decision on his alleged problems in his country of origin. The applicant was also the subject of removal proceedings from the Republic of Slovenia, which he formally discontinued by lodging an application for international protection. For the above reason, the defendant rightly concludes that he made the application only with a view to delaying or obstructing the implementation of the removal. Since his arrest by the police on 11 October 2019, he has had the opportunity to apply for international protection, but has not done so. He could have made an application earlier and not only at the time of his detention in the Detention Centre, as he was certainly aware of this possibility in the light of his previous applications. <p/> 4. In the further reasoning of the decision, the defendant explains in detail why it is necessary to restrict the applicant's movements to the premises of the Aliens Centre and not to the asylum centre, where such a restriction of movement could not be sufficiently effective. The purpose of the restriction of movement could not be achieved by a less severe measure, since there are no appropriate mechanisms in the asylum centre to prevent the departure of the asylum seeker from the asylum centre. <p/> 5. The applicant brings the present action on all the grounds laid down in Article 27 of the Administrative Disputes Act (hereinafter 'the ADL-1'). In his application, he submits that he has been consistent in his statements throughout. He had already lodged an application for international protection in Italy on 2 August 2018 and before that in France (4 July 2017). In Pakistan, his entire family is in dispute with his uncle over land left by his grandfather. The uncle has taken this land and is now threatening the complainant and his brother. Therefore, it would be difficult for him to go back as he is afraid of his uncle. At the same time, he wishes he could sell the land and move to Italy or Slovenia with his family. That's why he applied for international protection here as soon as he got out of prison .... He did not lodge his application in Slovenia with the intention of delaying or obstructing his removal from Slovenia. His application is substantive and genuine and is not made to obstruct the proceedings. Furthermore, a measure of restriction of movement to the Aliens Centre may only be ordered where, in a particular case, a measure of restriction of movement to the asylum centre cannot be effectively implemented. The defendant could have ordered a mandatory detention order in the asylum centre, which would have been a proportionate measure. The applicant claims that the Court should allow the action and set aside the contested order and, in the alternative, that the Court should allow the action, set aside the contested order and refer the case back to the defendant for further proceedings. <p/> 6. The applicant also applied for an interim injunction together with the application, requesting the court to suspend the operation of the contested order pending a final decision on that order. The contested order infringes the applicant's right to personal liberty. <7. In its reply to the application, the defendant submits that the contested order is lawful and correct and therefore maintains it and requests that the action be dismissed as unfounded. <p/> Concerning point I of the operative part of the judgment: <p/> 8. <In reaching its decision, the defendant relied on Article 84(1)(3) of the MZM-1.  It follows from Article 84, paragraph 3, of the Law on the Protection of the Persons with Disabilities, that the competent authority may order an applicant to be subject to a measure of compulsory detention in the territory of an asylum home where the applicant's movement is restricted as a result of the return procedure pursuant to the Law on the Entry, Stay and Departure of Aliens in the Republic of Slovenia, in order to carry out and enforce the return procedure or the removal procedure, and where there are grounds to believe that the applicant has made the application only to delay or obstruct the implementation of the removal procedure, where he/she has had the opportunity to apply for international protection. It follows from the above provision that several conditions must be cumulatively fulfilled in order for this ground for restriction of movement to be established. One of the conditions is that it may be reasonably assumed that the applicant made the application only to delay or impede the execution of the removal, when he had the possibility to apply for international protection. The defendant based its presumption that the applicant had made the application solely for the purpose of obstructing removal on the fact that he had not made the application earlier, even though he could have done so. <p/> 11. The provision of Article 84(3)(1) ZMZ-1 implements Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on standards for the reception of applicants for international protection ('Reception Directive II') in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia. The above-mentioned provision of the ZMZ-1 implements Article 8(3)(d) of the Reception Directive II. It provides that an applicant may be detained where the applicant is detained for the purpose of return proceedings in accordance with Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2008 on the application of the European Return Procedure (Directive 2008/115/EC). The Member State concerned may, on the basis of objective criteria, including the fact that the applicant has already had the opportunity to initiate the asylum procedure, conclude that there are reasonable grounds to believe that he/she is making the application solely to delay or impede the execution of the return decision. Furthermore, Article 8(3) of the Reception Directive II further provides that the grounds for detention are to be defined in national law. <p/> 12. That provision therefore expressly provides that the presumption that an applicant has made an application solely for the purpose of delaying his or her return may be justified on the basis of objective criteria. However, the current ZMZ-1 does not contain such objective criteria, which means that the above-mentioned provision of the Reception Directive II has not been fully implemented in the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia and, therefore, Article 8 of the Reception Directive II is directly applicable in accordance with the principle of primacy. Therefore, since the objective criteria have not been incorporated by the legislator into the ZMZ-1, it is not possible to restrict movement on this legal basis until the ZMZ-1 has been amended accordingly (Article 84(1)(3), first indent, ZMZ-1). The ZMZ-1 should lay down criteria by which it could be reasonably concluded whether an applicant has lodged an asylum application for the sole purpose of withholding his/her removal. Such objective criteria should also be laid down in the law in order to respect the basic principles underlying Reception Directive II. Thus, the introductory part of the cited Directive states in point 15 that the detention of applicants should be applied in accordance with the basic principle that a person should not be detained solely because he or she is seeking international protection, in particular in accordance with the international legal obligations of the Member States and Article 31 of the Geneva Convention. An applicant should only be detained in very clearly defined exceptional circumstances, as provided for in this Directive, and taking into account the principle of necessity and proportionality as regards both the manner and the purpose of such detention. <p/> 13. Therefore, since Reception Directive II explicitly provides in its introductory part that detention may only be carried out in very clearly defined exceptional circumstances, the criteria for presuming that someone has made an application solely for the purpose of obstructing removal must be sufficiently defined in law, and, as already explained, the current MHC-1 does not contain such objective criteria. The mere fact that an applicant lodges an asylum application at the time when removal from the country is being carried out does not in itself mean that he has lodged it solely for the purpose of obstructing removal, having regard to the fact that it is apparent from the data in the Eurodac database, which form part of the administrative file, that the applicant had previously lodged an application for international protection in Italy and France. <p/> 14. The Court further observes that the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia has already examined the correctness and lawfulness of the decision in cases X Ips 1/2019 and X Ips 11/2019 concerning Article 84(1)(5), first indent, of the ZMZ-1, which refers to Article 28 of Regulation 604/2013/EU ('the Dublin III Regulation'), and thus to the risk of absconding referred to in Article 2(n) of the Dublin III Regulation, which provides that the risk of absconding must be established on the basis of the objective criteria laid down by the law. The Supreme Court, in its judgments in the cases cited above, found that these criteria (despite Article 31(2) of the MZZ-1, which deals with the risk of absconding in a blanket manner) are not present in the MZZ-1, and that there is therefore no legal basis for the imposition of such a measure of restriction of movement. In the present case, the objective criteria for the defendant to be entitled to reasonably assume that the applicant is applying for international protection only to delay or impede the implementation of the return decision are not laid down in the law. The Court therefore concludes that there is no legal basis for the imposition of a movement restriction measure under Article 84 § 84 (3), first indent, of the MLM-1 in the present case either. <15. Since the Court of First Instance considers that, in the present case, there is therefore no ground for restriction of movement under the third indent of Article 84(1) of the ZMZ-1, the Court of First Instance annuls the contested decision on the basis of Article 64(1)(4) of the Causes of Action Act. Since the Court annulled the order on the ground that it had erred in the application of substantive law, it did not rule on all the other pleas relied on by the applicant in the application. <p/> 16. Article 84(6) of the CTMO-1 provides that the court shall, after hearing the applicant orally beforehand, decide on the applicant's application within three working days. It is clear from the draft ZMZ-11 that the hearing is to be held on the grounds of a substantial interference with the applicant's liberty, i.e. in his favour. However, in the present case, where there is no adequate basis for the measure of restriction of movement under Article 84(3), first paragraph, first indent, of the ZMZ-1, a hearing of the applicant would even achieve the opposite purpose. The holding of a main hearing would therefore be an end in itself; at the same time, the principle of the economy of proceedings would be infringed, since the court would have to ensure the applicant's presence, provide him with an interpreter and represent him by proxy in order to hear him, thereby incurring unnecessary procedural costs. Nor was the defendant's right to be heard thereby infringed, since he was served with the application, to which he replied. <p/> On point II of the operative part of the judgment: <p/> 17. The Court dismissed the application for interim measures, applying mutatis mutandis Article 36(1)(6) Causa-1, on the ground that, in the light of the decision on the application for interim measures, the applicant had no legal interest in the interim proceedings. In accordance with Article 73(1) of the Causes of Civil Procedure Act, no appeal is allowed against that judgment and, since no appeal is possible, the court's judgment (point I of the operative part of the operative part of the judgment) means that the court has given a final decision on the matter, and the applicant therefore no longer has a legal interest in the interim injunction, which is time-bound until the final decision. The final judgment of that judgment in itself terminates the restriction of movement, since the order for restriction of movement has been lifted.",Legal/Regulation

"BEAR <p/> A little bear was wandering alone in the forest. The boys found him there and surrounded him: ""Eat, how nice his fur is and how chubby he is, I bet his mother feeds him honey! "" they shouted and laughed at him. But the boys decided to have him shaved naked at the barber's and sell his soft, long hair for ice cream. They shouted. "" <p/>Wanted-wanted, the teddy bear had to go with them - to the barber's. <p/> ""Shave it off for us, at any cost! "" they shouted at the foreman, who put the little beast on a stool, thinking it was a puppy. The furry friend defended himself, but when he saw himself in the mirror, he remembered his mother. For a moment, he even frowned, thinking that this was the way it had to be. The barber shook him off, but the boys kept him quiet. He was getting more and more naked. The hair was flying off him like a doughy phantom. But when the foreman clipped him around the navel, it tickled him so much that he slipped out one paw and swung it at the foreman's bald head. <p/>""Away, away with that bitch, what do you think, pay up, and don't come to me again with such jokes,"" shouted the master, ""I can't stand your foolishness! ""The children grabbed the teddy bear and ran away. They released it in the woods, tied to a boulder, and watched to see what would happen. <p/> The teddy bear took her to a stream and looked in the water to see what it was like. He was so ashamed that he took her deep into the forest. He stepped on a wasp's nest. The wasps went into it. He rolled around, humming and hawking at them. Then, all miserable, he fell asleep. <p/> The magpies and all the other birds gathered over him and shouted: <p/> ""Hey you, go on! ""<p/> And the teddy bear just became a bear with beautiful fur, the most beautiful in the whole neighbourhood. All the little bears fell in love with him, but he only married one. They had lovely little bears that are still alive today, if poachers hadn't taken them. <p/> ANIMALS <p/> In a hole in the walls of an ancient city by the sea lived an animal unlike any our little Gabrijelce had ever seen: it had four clawed paws, a head, a torso and a long thin tail. Its body was covered with light brown scales. <p/> Before the animal crawled into a black hole in the walls of the ancient city by the sea, it showed Gabrijelca its tongue. <p/> ""Mama, the animal showed me its tongue! "" said Gabrijelca, offended. <p/> Mom: <p/> ""Don't mind, it won't do you any harm, you see it has escaped into the black hole! "" <p/> ""Does the animal have a mother? "" asked Gabrijelca. <p/> ""Yes, this animal has a mom and a dad too! "" said Gabrijelca's mother. <p/> ""Where do the animal, its father and mother have an apartment? "" <p/> ""You know, because the animal was naughty and showed her tongue to her dad and mum, she had to leave home. Now she lives alone in a hole in this wall. Once she even crawled onto a big ship in the harbour and went around the world. All the time she was hiding from the bad sailors. When the ship finally returned to this ancient city by the sea, the animal made it ashore. Her parents disliked her even more from then on. And so the animal lives all alone in this hole in this ancient city by the sea! "" the mother finished. <p/> ""What about the animal papa? "" <p/> ""Since the animal has no teeth, it has to eat flies and worms,"" said the mother. <p/> ""Uh, I couldn't eat flies and worms! "" said the Little Goose. <p/> ""Yes, just be diligent, don't run away from home and don't show your tongue to anyone, don't sulk and don't get angry, and you'll be fine by me and your dad! It happens to naughty people that they have to go into a black hole. You see, for example, the fox, the badger, the mouse and the rat..."" <p/> ""That's right, Mum! I'll be diligent, not naughty like the badger and the fox! "" concluded the conversation of the Little Goose. <p/> GABRIELCA - the only child - wanted a brother. Since the maternity hospital no longer had any for her and she would have to stay on her own, she wanted at least an animal, be it a puppy, a kitten or a bird. Eventually she got to know all the dog breeds, but what she wanted most of all was a poodle - a curly-haired, ornamental city puppy, shaved to the lion's head, although she is afraid of anything that crawls and goes, and especially shakes when a larger dog appears and has to be picked up. <p/> Ata had to keep telling Gabrijelca that poodles, in particular, sucked in the house, they were a nuisance, as they were no guardians because they didn't dare to bite, and it was difficult with them if there wasn't a garden for them to run around and do their business by the fence, bush or tree. Such were Atos' contradictory teachings, but Gabrijelca only dreamt of a puppy. <p/>When she could already write, she wrote a letter to her teacher, Foltin, asking him to save one puppy - a little mix - for her to take on the bus home. She stuck the stamp on correctly, wrote the address and sent the letter. <p/> Teacher Foltin took her letter seriously. He brought the puppy - a baby - to the city himself, hoping that it would be well with Gabrijelca. <p/> Thus Gabrijelca's first wish came true: she became the proud owner of her beloved puppy. She named him Medo, because he was the most like a teddy bear. <p/> Of course, she had to show her teddy bear to all the children in the neighbourhood. They would all have loved to have a puppy like that, but this was hers. In time, she will teach him all sorts of arts and he will guard her faithfully in case a man with evil intentions ever comes, so she will make sure he is comfortable with her! <p/> Probably because Medo was from the country, he didn't know how to behave in the city in the first days and did the needful on the carpet. Mum patiently cleared the matter up. But as this happened several more times, she became unwilling. At night, Medo missed his mother's warmth and also craved her milk, so he cried and scratched at the door, so that his mother had to put him under the blankets, where he fell asleep, lying on his back like his father. <p/> But when all three of us had to leave the house in the morning, Medo whimpered sadly all morning and called for Gabrijelco. It would be like this all day long, so her mother started telling her that it couldn't go on like this, that the flat would start to smell, that the door would get more and more scratched and what else! She persisted for a few more days, but finally she ordered her to write to the teacher Foltin to come and get a puppy, because they couldn't have one. <p/> And Teacher Foltin wondered very much what the lovely animal had done to offend him so. And he really put Medek back in the car and drove him away. <p/> Gabrijelca silently endured her first sorrow. She realised that she could not have a puppy. To remember him, she pasted a colour photograph of herself with Medek in her arms into an album. <p/> ANIMAL <p/> Gabrijelca saw a tiny animal on top of a thistle. It was red with tiny spots all over its back and its head was all black. It was spinning around as if it did not know the way to the ground. It wanted to go somewhere higher, but it slipped on the ground. She crawled and crawled, up Gabrijelca's leg, onto her skirt, off her skirt onto her hand, and her hand right on the end of Gabrijelca's finger. No, she didn't bite her. <p/> As Gabrijelca was looking at her and she raised her finger to her eyes, the animal began to twist and turn. Then it lifted its two little caps, and spread its two transparent wings underneath, and it flew, high and far away - into the wide world. <p/> If only Gabrijelca could do all that! Her wing can barely stretch in the wind, but she cannot fly under the sky with it. Why is all this so? She would like to fly into the world that is for everyone... <p/> The animal was a ladybird. My father took a pen and wrote a poem after the ladybird. <p/> The little girl cries out to her. <p/> DRAGON <p/> In a hole in a wall made of big stones lived an animal - a little dragon. Perhaps he was the son of the great dragon that Ferdinand told us about. The little dragon was slipping from hole to hole, and supposedly had no other work to do. <p/> But a boy comes along with a bag. The dragon shows him his tongue and wants to go down the hole. The offended boy tears off his tail and puts it in his bag. <p/> But lo and behold: the next day, the little dragon shows his tongue again. The boy gets angry, tears off the tail and puts it in his bag. <p/> This is what the boy did on the third, fourth day of the holiday. When he had quite a few tails in his bag, he tied them together into one long tail, threw one end to a pig - over a cloud, climbed up on the cloud and looked at the world below him. He saw cities by the sea, ships and islands. So he sailed on a soft cloud around the world. And the sun warmed him so that he fell asleep. <p/> Apparently he was getting hungry. When he looked at the ground, he saw the old wall under him again. He crawled down on his bound tails towards the earth. He got to his feet right in front of the patisserie by the sea. He immediately ordered chocolate, blueberry and vanilla ice creams. He was about to bring it to his mouth when he woke up at home in bed. <p/> He wondered whether it was an illusion or the truth. <p/> BIRD <p/> If Gabrijelca wasn't allowed to have a puppy, she asked her mum and dad for a bird. One day, all three of them walked into a bird shop. <p/> Wow, there were so many cages and all kinds of parakeets: green, white and blue, and yellow, coloured and white canaries. And the turtledoves! They were hopping from stick to stick, swinging, flitting, climbing, chirping and singing to each other and huddling together in groups. Gabrijelca just opened her eyes, she would have loved to have them all, they were all equally cute. She chose the blue parrot, and my father had to reach into his pocket and they were marching with the little bird across the square and through the streets towards the idol. <p/> Mum set up the cage in the kitchen in the dining corner. My dad had told me to keep the cage open so that the bird wouldn't be locked in like a bandit. And it stayed that way. <p/> But the parakeet found nothing in the kitchen where he could sit down. It circled in the air in the shape of a figure of eight and landed on its cage, from where it surveyed its new surroundings, and when it got hungry or thirsty, it went to its home. <p/> Gabrijelca left the cleaning of the cage, the food and water to his mother and father. <p/> ""That's the way it is: children want something, but when they get it, they don't care about it anymore! "" the father declaimed. <p/> Gabrijelca waited for the parrot to start talking. She kept repeating some magic words to him, but the bird said nothing! The parrot, besides the cat, the dog, the horse and the elephant, must be an extremely clever witness, but you just have to understand it. And that they were poor birds who had to live in cigarette smoke and chirp to the company inside until midnight. He also thought that bird talk certainly meant nothing, because even human conversations often have no head or tail. He told Gabriélica to leave the bird alone, to behave itself. <p/> Well, he soon learned to fly on the toes of the atu. The atta brought an empty flower pot into the kitchen, which he liked to sit on and look around the kitchen, but he didn't like to go into the room. Over time, he would shriek if the tap dripped water, if the pot started to boil and when all three of them left the house. He watched carefully from a distance as his mother cleaned his cage. He also knew Gabrijelco and had become a member of the family. <p/> As Gabrijelca thought the bird was a bit lonely, she started to nag him to get a mate. One day, she and her mother brought home a brown-headed nuthatch. <p/> Dad looked down from under his forehead. But because he had had a dove when he was young, she was allowed to stay in the house. <p/> The parakeet was also looking at it from under his forehead. Curiosity or even jealousy drove him to visit the dove. Perhaps she was a threat to his kingdom. How he marvelled when the little bird tried to sing to him. He flew to her cage, tickled her with his beak and teased her until she ran out of the cage. Gentle and patient, she waited for her return, for the parrot to stop reigning on her chopsticks and eating her food. In the following days she wanted to return the visit, but she was not allowed in his cage. <p/> There was too much ghost on her throat, too much cleaning and worrying for both of them. Mum told Attu that one of the birds had to leave the house. <p/> ""The throat will have to go! "" the mother announced to Gabrijelci. Once, when her daughter wasn't home, she grabbed the cage and took it to the bird shop, saying: <p/> ""There you have it and keep it. Give it to whoever you want! ""And she was gone. <p/> The shop assistant was astonished. She watched for the strange woman, who disappeared down the nearest alleyway for hours. What was it about this lovely animal that she resented so much? What should she do with the bird: should she really give it away or sell it again? she thought. She had indeed sold it once. <p/> Dad had a few words of anger about Mum's hastiness. Mom just said: <p/> ""That's not the way it goes anymore! ""<p/> THE DEATH OF A DOG <p/> Four times Koki was very sad: when Gabrijelca went to the seaside with her mother and Ata for a holiday and he had to stay with strangers he didn't know and wasn't used to his new surroundings, even though he was doing well. <p/> But one day, at the beginning of his fifth year, he fell off his stick in his cage and lay on his back - dead. The zookeeper found that he had suffered a heart attack because his father had given him biscuits. All three of them mourned him. <p/> Gabrijelca respectfully buried the corpse, wrapped in newsprint, against the wall in the yard. She lined the grave with pebbles and placed a small wreath in the middle. <p/> One day, Gabrijelca cried convulsively. Through their tears, her father and mother found out that someone had vandalised Koki's grave, scattering flowers, a wreath and pebbles. She said she would complain about this barbarity at the residents' meeting. Her father and mother told her that if she told them that her Koki was buried in the grave, it must have been the naughty children who had done it. When her father asked her if Kokki's corpse had also been kicked out, she nodded and felt somewhat comforted. She herself went to dig him up and brought him to the balcony, where she buried him again in a flower trough, and on the new grave she put the first flowers of spring, and a new wreath, and stuck a wooden cross with a veil from one of her mother's dresses in the finger. One evening in mid-March, she lit two candles for him. The two little flames flickered beautifully, illuminating the walls of the balcony. <p/> The memory of Kokec lives on in the family. The corner where he made his home is now empty. They still feel that he will sing and fly on Gabrijelca's head.",Prose

"Description. We presented the public goods game, its rules, strategies and possible payoffs. We have presented the three main elementary strategies for playing the public goods game. These are co-operation, co-operation with reward and co-operation with punishment. In order to make the results comparable throughout the paper, we have tried to choose parameters where we can compare the results directly or at least within some reasonable similarity. The presentations of the elementary strategies showed that they contribute to fostering the development of cooperation and that punishment is the most successful of the presented ones, because it fosters cooperation even at lower synergy factors. The presentation of the elementary strategies is followed by a test of whether there are any evolutionary advantages in combining correlated positive and negative reciprocity into a single strategy. Similarly to the presentation of the elementary strategies, we have also looked at the strategy of simultaneous reward and punishment and obtained results showing that, independently of the synergy factor at which the simulations were run, the combined strategy of punishment and reward did not show evolutionary advantages over the elementary strategies of reward and, in particular, punishment. While narrow bands have been shown for very unrealistic parameters where the combined strategy can show its strength, it also appears that punishment alone would be superior for the same parameters.

"Why a GTi when there's an XY <p/> Peugeot has offered two special versions of its little 208. Choose the GTi, or the considerably cheaper XY, which, despite its slightly weaker power unit, meets the needs of dynamic drivers. <p/> Nomen est omen, a name is a sign, goes the Latin proverb. Janez Novak is the name of a hard-working Slovene who does not take the right to spend his holidays on a towel by the sea, who is willing to change all his nails for the victory of our basketball players, who is happy with two beers, now and then, he also manages, following the example of ""the rich ones"", to outsmart the state on a levy or squeeze reimbursement from the insurance company for the damage caused to his car by a stranger in the car park in front of his best neighbour. <p/> Not a cliché <p/> With the car code XY, similar clichés might be in the foreground. Ixipsilon it is. But they aren't. The Peugeot 208 XY is actually a very nice refresher, and something of an example that there is still a reserve even in the classic B-segment and that taking buyers between crossovers is not necessarily the right solution, not even for their wallets. The special equipment and extras of the little Peugeot give it a considerable boost on the street. Different front light cues with distinctive white daytime running lights, 17-inch wheels, rear spoiler, chrome inserts including logos, a bold choice of purple for the name... <p/> Parallels with the chunky GTi <p/> Inside, the premium sporty feel is also very much in evidence thanks to the seats, the led lighting and trim, the large screen of the powerful, at times over-complicated infotainment, the dual-zone climate control, the self-dimming mirror, the metal gear lever (a very uncomfortable feeling in weather extremes)... there are plenty of other parallels with the chunkiest of the litter, the GTI. <p/>Both are three-door only, both have wider tracks and a stiffer chassis. And both have unusually positioned gauges for the sake of clarity, so you sit up high, higher than is appropriate for a car inspired by its illustrious predecessors, because, like the GTI, the XY has an ancestor in one of the more civilian versions of the little ripper from 25 years ago. <p/> 156 hp the right choice <p/> So the 208 XY has plenty of sporty driving talent, so despite the diesel option, it's a real sin not to be powered by the (cheaper! ) 1.6 THP engine. Fortunately for the tester, it is. You could say that the powertrain was very lively most of the time, i.e. during normal journeys and during known distances. Good consumption, torque at low revs, good cooperation with the gearbox. When it had to, the car left the figure in the drawer and became a little wrecker, 115 kilowatts at low weight is just not that easy. It didn't shy away from corners either, the chassis and small steering wheel making it easy to handle even close to the limits of physics. It's almost a sin to write, but in a corner it was even more unrelenting than the much sportier RCZ. <p/> A thoroughbred aristocratic underclass yet very talented, this XY. When a GTI pulls up alongside it, there's no end to the embarrassment. Is the extra 40-odd horsepower of the GTI, which is the only real difference between the two cars, even worth almost four grand extra? Indeed, at a discount of just over 16 grand, with all that equipment and power for an iksipsilon, it seems like just the right ""deal."" And both sexes can enjoy it equally.",Promotion

"Added to project. Now we can create an A4 invoice and it is printed on A4. Later, we can print it on pos via Invoice Viewer, but it is already copy 1. <p/> This would come into play when we give someone an offer and later they pay in cash and we give them a pos printout. I suggest that somehow we add the option to print via pos printer, whether it be ""Create pos invoice"" or some other option for pos printout and cash payment. Cash payment is already possible if we do not choose another payment type (TRR or card), just a pos printout would be welcome. <p/> As already stated ""if we do not choose another payment type (TRR or card)"", the invoice is entered as cash and is confirmed by FURS. For A4 printout, the invoice prints ok. However, if we print the invoice later via the ""Invoice Viewer"" on the pos printer, it does not print CASH at the very end, but FOR PAYMENT. <p/> When the option for pos printout is added already in the base, I guess this will be reconciled? <p/> Sorry, I don't know how to do it right. If the due date is set to a later date, it will print FOR PAYMENT in the pos statement, but CASH in the A4 statement, and if the due date is the same date as the invoice it will print CASH in both cases. <p/> However, it might be a good idea, if the upgrade is to be made so that the offer can also be used for cash payment and the pos printout, to automatically set the due date for cash payment to the invoice date, or to always print CASH, because we don't print the due date on the cash invoice itself, and it shouldn't be on the A4 printout of the cash invoice, because if we have a due date set for a later date in the offer, the invoice automatically takes it into account, and then the due date is later on the A4 printout, but the cash payment is today, for example.

"Kundalini Yoga <p/> GUIDE <p/> Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan is the ideal discipline for the modern man of today. <p/> The techniques of Kundalini Yoga bring us quite quickly to a balance between the physical body, mind and soul.The well thought out and composed practice units called kriyas help us to support a healthy, contented and spiritual lifestyle. They work in a targeted way with a specific purpose, such as to strengthen the immune and nervous systems, balance the functioning of the glands and internal organs, increase circulation, maintain psycho-physical vitality, ease depressive states, etc. In addition, they enhance the functioning of the neutral or meditative mind, the faculties of intelligence, perseverance and perfection. A clear, neutral and intuitive mind gives us the ability to become aware of and change our own patterns, fears and habits that prevent us from moving forward in life. <p/> This is why Kundalini Yoga is so appropriate for today, empowering us, uplifting us and building a foundation to cope with the stresses and turbulence of today, a time of moving into the Aquarian Age, an age of higher consciousness and peace. <p/> ""Kundalini Yoga is a technology of knowing and awakening consciousness that leads us to the original Self. Usually this consciousness, which we call kundalini, is dormant within us and therefore awareness and experience of the Self is more or less limited. Awareness can be awakened and expanded up to Infinity and only then can I experience my true Self. Infinity is my original Self. In this expanded state nothing is lacking. The process of growth through Kundalini Yoga is the natural unfoldment of one's own nature. The obstacles on the path of growth are only the attachments to the habits of the past and the fears of the Infinite or the expanded Self.""",Promotion
"Sculpture <p/> 13.03.2014 <p/> by Gregor Šket <p/> A sensual body, full curves, a carefully calculated geometry based on the ellipse. A long nose that hides something strong and big inside. The nostril flirts with infinity without beginning or end. The rear is elegantly muscular and subtly erotic. Technique: sculpture in iron, dimensions: 4453x1657x1273 mm, by Sir William Lyons, Malcom Sayer, William M. Heynes, vintage: 1961-1974. This is what it says on the plaque marking one of their greatest exhibits, a four-wheeled sculpture, the Jaguar XKE, E-Type, in the department of MoMA, New York's Museum of Modern Art. And MoMA only has six cars: a jeep willis, a Smart, a Cistalia 202 GT, a Ferrari Formula 1 641/2, a Volkswagen Beetle and the Jaguar e-type, which was added to the collection in 1996. <p/> But it has been clear since its birth that the e-type is a speciality that is actually much more than just a car. After all, Enzo Ferrari knew it as soon as he saw it. It wasn't easy for him. He must have swallowed his saliva with great difficulty, but sportingly admitted: ""This is the most beautiful car ever made! ""It is hard to imagine how much strength and trampled pride it took for the great Il Commendatore to pay such a flattering tribute to a car that was not from the Apennine Peninsula but from the British Isles. Somehow, he was saying what has always been known anyway: with all due respect to the Germans, only the Apennine Peninsula and the British Isles can make really good supercars. From today's point of view, the irony is that series production of cars in both centres of super-sport has virtually come to a standstill, or at least is in a very difficult situation that smacks of perpetual decline. <p/> A symbol of the 1960s <p/> At the end of the 1950s, following their success at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Jaguar's engineers, developers and designers were tasked with creating an all-new sports two-seater to replace the legendary XK150. In 1957, the E1A prototype was created, but it was only available for factory testing. Three years later, the E2A prototype followed and achieved some racing success. When the carpet was unveiled at a press conference at the Parc des Eaux Vives restaurant in Geneva on 15 March 1961, the gathering was breathless. In front of them stood a piece of automotive art which, for the time, represented the very avant-garde, a glimpse of the future, something unseen, something new... The Jaguar XKE, also known as the e-type. Interestingly, they had no special plans for the newcomer, but rather than sales success, they were counting on racing victories. But it turned out the other way round. Although the XKE was initially intended only for export to the North American market, it was also unexpectedly popular and in demand at home. It also convinced with its relatively affordable price of £2,256 at the time (around £38,000 today, or around €45,000). Of course, it was soon behind the wheel of many movie and sports stars of the 1960s, such as George Best, Brigitte Bardot, Tony Curtis, Steve McQueen, etc. <p/> Designed by an aeronaut <p/> The e-type's design is by designer Malcom Sayer. As an aeronautical engineer, he was of course a master of aerodynamics. And this is probably the main reason why the e-type offered a design that was revolutionary for its time and remarkably modern. At first sight, the car was a sight to behold, with a virtually perfect shape. The side view revealed a cigar-shaped form, dominated by a long bonnet that flowed into a relatively short cabin. From any angle, the E-type reveals the designer's remarkable sense of aesthetics, proportion, right angles and proportions. Its rear end evokes feminine curves, its front end may look like a shark, but in its aggressiveness it exudes something friendly, soft, warm, almost childlike. All accentuated by thoughtful chrome detailing and typical English wheels made of interwoven spokes. Inside, it's a sort of miniature sexy English saloon - leather seats, leather steering wheel, classic switchgear and dashboard gauges. <p/> Three body styles and three series <p/> The E-type was initially available as a two-door coupe, known as FHC (Fixed Head Coupe), and as a convertible, known as OTS (Open Two Seater). A few years later, the 2+2 coupe was launched. The coupe was lengthened by about 20 centimetres and two makeshift rear seats were added to allow four adult passengers to ride in the e-type. At first glance, the 2+2 Coupe does not have the same harmonious lines and angles of the exterior. Connoisseurs say the cabin sticks out too much and, above all, the side lines are not as elegant. <p/> The e-type was initially powered by a 3.8-litre six-cylinder engine, which was replaced by a 4.2-litre unit in 1964. Both engines gave the car superb driveability. The speedometer only stopped at 240 kilometres per hour, and it accelerated to 100 km/h in seven seconds. <p/> It also underwent a few cosmetic changes during the 13 years of series production, during which 70,000 examples were built. In 1968, the Series 2 was launched, distinguished on the outside mainly by slightly different tail lights hidden under the bumpers, and on the inside by different switches on the dashboard. In 1971, the 3 Series was launched, which introduced a 12-cylinder 5.3-litre engine and was also quite different externally. Unfortunately, even at that time, the rule was that cosmetic changes were really a deterioration. The 3 Series E-type no longer had such a friendly bonnet, its front end was no longer classic Jaguar, but had a few Citroën elements. The side line was also spoilt, as the E-type had its front wings opened up too much. In fact, the third series heralded the arrival of the all-new XJ-S, which arrived just a year after the e-type's retirement, but was in no respect even close to its predecessor. <p/> Auto-erotic <p/> The E-type is one of the few cars whose physical presence evokes purely non-automotive emotions. It feels like a sculpture on four wheels. As such, it is, of course, a remarkable example of industrial design and therefore, of course, it has a special place in the history of both motoring and design. There are few examples where these two worlds intertwine, intersect and interact so effectively and, above all, so seamlessly. <p/> That's why, half a century after its birth, it is still one of the most beautiful cars in the world. The Daily Telegraph has listed it as one of the 100 most beautiful cars in the world, and Sports Car International magazine has ranked it number one in a similar list.

If you have formatted it successfully then use programs ala Recuva, PCInspector FileRecovery, etc. If the explorer sees it (that it has a letter assigned to it e.g. X) then do a chkdsk in the Command Prompt window with the command: chkdsk x: /f If the format didn't go through then let me know what you report!

This multiplication starts the moment I connect the USB to the computer and ends when I switch it off. Everything I have described is happening to me on Win 7 Ultimate. I have also tried it on XP. There the matter behaves slightly differently. I don't get any warning when I plug in the key. The computer detects the key, but when I try to open it, I get a warning that the key needs to be formatted. I didn't do this in XP, but I'll try it there as you advised. <p/> So, to continue from my last post in this thread. I have tried to format the key with the aforementioned Rufus program on both OSes (Windows 7 Ultimate and XP), but to no avail. I also tried running the key on all possible USB ports as you advised. The case behaves as follows. When I connect the key to my computer and open Rufus, the window from this program starts flashing at 2 second intervals. Nevertheless, it allows me to select ""quick format"". Then I start the formatting and after a good second the message ""FAILED"" appears in the bottom frame of Rufus and in an additional cloud ""Error: Error while partitioning drive"". I tried to save the data with Wondershare's File scavenger. When I started the scan, it displayed ""No relevant data found! Please click Options on the right top and unselect Only scan unused sectors when scanning. Then try to scan again"". I also heeded this warning and repeated the scan. Unfortunately still no success. I also tried CMD's ""chkdsk"" command, but it says ""The type of the file system is RAW. Chkdsk is not available for RAW drives"". <p/> I assume the USB stick size is showing wrong or 0. In this case it is not possible to format in low level format or any other format. All you need is to download the chipgenius program: http://www.usbdev.ru/files/chipgenius/ It reads the USB stick, with a bit of luck tells you which controller it is and where to get the controller reset tool. If not, you can find the tool on the net via vid and pid number. All other attempts to format will be futile and a waste of time. <p/> marko-x wrote: <p/> If I try to format a key with File scavenger, it shows me the size of its memory, but next to it it says Unlocated partition.

But ok, now you've come up with the word RAW yourself, which would be obvious from the DiskManagement image. And usually a right click on that grey box is enough to initialize the whole partition/size of the stick then the quick format and data rescue goes better with all the programs listed.

This cool new idea is now available for the first time in the form of Red Bull Formula Face - turn on your webcam, relax your facial and neck muscles, tilt your head, blink and take the first turn with turbo acceleration. <p/> The new online game is based on the latest technology, where you use your face to navigate around the track. It's a world premiere. The user uses a webcam to track their facial expressions. The game is free, suitable for both PC and Mac, does not need to be downloaded to your computer and can be tested at www.redbullformulaface.com. <p/> Red Bull Formula Face does away with the joystick altogether. It used to be about the player's manual dexterity to win or lose, but now all you need is a webcam and your face. A wink to turbo acceleration and a head tilt to cornering? It's easy with Red Bull Formula Face. You're just a few steps away from your first interactive race: turn on the webcam, choose your favourite character, personalise it with your own photo, choose a Formula 1, NASCAR or rally car and your personal avatar is ready to go! There are three different levels to battle against the computer. <p/> The facial control technology developed for Red Bull Formula Face is both simple and revolutionary: tilt your head left or right to manoeuvre your car on the track. The aim of the game, which has a paper-like appearance, is to score as many points as possible. Flicking your eyes triggers turbo accelerations that can leave your opponent in a puff of smoke. You can activate the add-ons you collect during the game at any time, and they give you a decisive advantage: a pair of wings to propel you far forward, monster tyres to run over your opponent, or glue and scissors to stop them. <p/> Photo bonuses give you lots of extra points and guaranteed laughs: they start as soon as you hit one of the cameras hovering over the track. They reward the player who mimics the facial expressions shown as closely as possible. You can save the photos you take to your Red Bull Formula Face profile and share them with your friends on Facebook. The result of the last race is also posted - and you can bet that your friends will race to beat you and post the craziest photos they can. For those who are good at handwork, you can download a PDF of your avatar and build an origami racer to take to the table. <Stefan Becker from BUZZIN MONKEY, the company responsible for the concept and creation of Red Bull Formula Face, had this to say about the innovative new game: ""For the first time ever, you can control the game without any special hardware such as a console or joystick - all you need is your face and facial expressions - and it's all tightly integrated with the social network.

This shows, according to analysts, that the independence of the judiciary in this Balkan country, which has been an EU member since 2007, is strengthening, albeit slowly. <p/> ""You have made great strides forward, especially in the last five years, and I call on all Romanians (...) to fight even harder to defend the independence of the judiciary and to keep it out of politics,"" the high-ranking US guest stressed today in Bucharest after a meeting with Romanian President Traian Basescu and Foreign Minister Titus Corlatean, the French news agency AFP reports. <p/> The Austrian news agency APA adds that the Romanian authorities, expecting harsh words, had already warned the US before the visit not to raise the issue of Romanian justice and reminded that Romania is not an American colony. But this did not seem to stop Nuland. <p/> Her words referred to the Romanian Parliament's attempt to provide a kind of ""super-immunity"" to MPs and local politicians by amending the Penal Code and the law on amnesties and pardons. This would also protect incumbent politicians from possible corruption charges. In addition, politicians already convicted of corruption could be pardoned, APA writes. <p/> The US immediately branded the attempt at the end of December as ""a step away from transparency and the rule of law"", while the EU and several of its members, including Germany and France, also expressed concern. In the end, Bucharest only caved in under pressure and postponed the adoption of the law until February, but it has not yet been abandoned. <p/> Further discontent was caused by statements by Socialist Prime Minister Victor Ponta, a sworn opponent of the conservative President Basescu, in which he accused the special prosecutor for the fight against corruption, DNA, and the integrity body, ANI, of being subject to the ""Basescu regime"" and of ruling unfairly. Last week, the Prime Minister even compared the recent second corruption conviction of Nastase to the imprisonment of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko in Ukraine. <p/> The situation in Romania was most acute last year, when Ponta's centre-left coalition tried to oust Basescu by referendum. In attempting to do so, it, among other things, blatantly interfered with the independence of the Romanian Constitutional Court.",News

"DEVELOPMENTAL AMBULANCE WITH EARLY TREATMENT CENTRE AT MURSKOSOBOŠ HOSPITAL <p/> 29.07.2019 <p/> Murska Sobota, 29 July - The Developmental Outpatient Clinic with an Early Treatment Centre has been operating at Murska Sobota General Hospital since July this year. Extended individual and team treatment focuses on the child and the whole family. <p/> As of 1 January 2019, a new Act on Integrated Early Treatment of Children with Special Needs came into force. This has transformed the former development clinics into Early Treatment Centres for Children with Special Needs by strengthening the teams with an increase in the number of medical staff and other professionals. The development clinic with an Early Treatment Centre at the Soboga Hospital will provide extended individual and team treatment by a specialist paediatrician, physiotherapist, registered and paramedical nurse, health administrator, occupational therapist, speech and language therapist, social worker, special educator, psychologist and other specialists as needed. The ground floor of the old maternity hospital building was renovated to accommodate the expanded development clinic. This means that there are now 3 modern, well-equipped outpatient clinics, which are easily and friendly accessible, even for the most physically handicapped. <p/> A very important innovation of the new approach to children with special needs is the involvement of the child's family and multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary teamwork in their treatment. The centres or extended development clinics are linked to kindergartens, primary schools, the social work centre and others. In this way, all the stakeholders involved in the treatment of a child with special needs and his/her family are brought together to form a whole that provides systemic support to families. <p/> In Slovenia, around 400 children with special needs are newly included in early intervention each year, while a total of 1 200 children receive early intervention in the pre-school period. Last year, 498 children were screened in 3,134 sessions at the hospital in Sobotka and this year (January-June) 377 children were screened in 2,129 sessions. <p/> Contact",News

"In a logistic sense, a ""rare disease"" - e.g. operable childhood epilepsy - is an enormous challenge for the health service of a small country, which has to provide the highest quality treatment in centres that have the experience to do the job - and these can only be developed in settings with sufficient referrals, i.e. abroad. Slovenia is too small for it to be professionally and economically rational to develop specialised teams for all complex diagnostic procedures and surgical treatment of childhood epilepsy. The prerequisite of ""at least 25 operations per year"" (and, at the same time, a steady stream of intensive diagnostic treatments) is not achievable in such a small population, and we are therefore urgently dependent on collaborative action in international networks. Of course, if there is no national support for more enterprising ideas and real support for an organisation to disseminate its own knowledge and work for patients in a more grey region. Patients in the region are interested, they come to Slovenia for other opinions and advice. But it has long been the case that in Slovenia, the health policy has never supported the views of the Syrians, not even when it was about the big and world-renowned names (neurosurgery). Today, staffing is barely sufficient to prepare our patients, who are rightly sent abroad for further treatment. The profession has never had the support of management in this either. Where are we if we wanted to offer this to the wider region? <p/> It would be very wrong, in a time of 'austerity' in a time of global financial crisis, to start applying restrictions to those patients who are most vulnerable and in whom it is reasonable to expect a major improvement in health. It would be very wrong for the recently launched public debate (e.g. by Spomenka Hribar, certainly well intentioned) to be based on bad publicity. <p/> The fact that carefully selected children with epilepsy go for treatment to the best foreign centres is, in fact, also proof of the quality of our health care. Nasa's reflections on the theme 'to be or not to be ... an orphan' have also been well received in international circles, particularly in Scandinavia. Our proposal for targeted project work by small countries on this topic is being considered. <p/> prim Igor M Ravnik, Head of the Centre for Epilepsy in Children and Adolescents President, League Against Epilepsy Slovenia Ambassador of Epilepsy, International League Against Epilepsy",Opinion/Argumentation
"Friday 29 December 2006 <p/> In December 2006, on the margins of the European Social Platform meeting at the Grand Hotel Union in Ljubljana, representatives of the Family Initiative met with Mr William Lay, Executive Director of COFACE - Confédération des Organisations Familiales de l'Union Européenne, or in Slovene the Confederation of Family Organisations of the European Union. We presented to Mr Lay the state of family policy in Slovenia and the efforts of the Family Initiative to develop family-friendly legislation in Slovenia. We presented the current proposals and initiatives for legislative change in Slovenia that we have prepared in the Family Initiative. We presented proposals to increase the competitiveness of parents in the labour market, proposals to improve the conditions for families with several children in the area of childcare, proposals to amend pension legislation and proposals for a fairer distribution of the costs of childcare between parents and individuals without children. The overall conclusion of the participants was that the Family Initiative is working on proposals that are also relevant for other members of the European Alliance. On the other hand, we can better draw on experience from abroad to identify family policy measures that have already shown results there. Family policy is implemented in each Member State separately and in a disconnected manner, and the European Union does not have a common family policy. For this reason, NGOs working to improve family policy in individual countries have joined together to form a common organisation, COFACE. So far, there has been no Slovenian representative in this organisation. That is why Mr Lay invited the Family Initiative to take an active part in this association. Those present agreed that membership in this organisation would be beneficial for both the Family Initiative and family policy in Slovenia. We believe that the benefits of membership would also justify the additional costs associated with membership. We parted with the hope of meeting next time as full members of COFACE, and thus to work together on family policy in the European Union. <p/> Thursday 12 October 2006 <p/> The coalition groups listened to the warnings of the Family Initiative that the proposed Income Tax Law, in the article providing for tax relief for dependent children, should be amended so as not to worsen the relative position of parents compared to taxpayers without children. Based on our warnings, the NSi, SDS and SLS groups of MEPs have drafted amendments to correct the draft law. In the course of the coordination with the Ministry of Finance, it was finally decided to amend the Bill by increasing the progressivity step of the tax relief from the third child onwards from EUR 748 to EUR 1500. While this solution does not meet the full requirements of the Family Initiative, it does address the main anomaly and shortcoming of the proposed law. For a number of families, the proposal will also not only maintain, but even slightly improve their relative position compared to taxpayers with the same income without children. <p/> Compared to the original proposal of the Family Initiative, the State will now make some savings and we expect that this will make it easier to implement other, perhaps even more important, family policy measures, such as incentives for parents to take up employment after the return of parental leave and part-time work. <p/> At this point, I would like to commend the cooperation of the expert colleagues of the NSi and SDS Groups of Members of the European Parliament and of some of their MEPs, who, during the negotiations with the Ministry of Finance, also checked the proposals and solutions they discussed with us, thus enabling us to participate constructively in this process with our own calculations and assessments. <p/> Tuesday, 30 May 2006 <p/> On World Family Day in May, we held a well-attended round table discussion at the General Assembly entitled The fertility problem between parents and the state, which was attended by the Minister of Finance, Dr Andrej Bajuk, the State Secretary at the Ministry of Education and Science, Dr Magdalena Šverc, the Director of the Directorate for the Family at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Development, Ms Majda Erzar, and the Acting Head of the Housing Sector at the Ministry of the Interior, Ms Anita Hočevar Frantar. The round table and its content were reported in most media. <p/> Thursday, 01 December 2005 <p/> The Family Initiative wrote to Prime Minister Janez Janša on 4 November 2005 asking for a discussion on measures to increase the birth rate and improve the situation of families, and the context of the proposed reforms from the perspective of parents and families. <p/> On 25.11.2005 we received a rather vague reply from the Prime Minister's Office.",News
"A lesbian and feminist club in every village Saturday, 14 January 2012 author / ica: IdaH <p/> The enhanced editorial team of Sector Ž will present Vesna Vravnik's new short film A lesbian club in every village, which premiered last December at the Canteen at the Trough. At the same time, the first results of an extensive research on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia will be presented. The project will be presented by the author of the film and Eva Gračanin, Legebitra Programme Manager. In the second part, we will talk to Vesna Leskošek about the national survey on violence in the private sphere. <p/> Dear feminists. Welcome to the Sector Ž show on this beautiful winter Saturday, which almost smells like the eighth of March. The strengthened and expanded editorial team of the show will present a new short film by Vesna Vravnik, A Lesbian Club in Every Village. The film premiered last December at the Café at the Trough in Metelkova. At the same time, the first results of an extensive research on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia were presented. The project will be presented by the author of the film and Eva Gračanin, head of the youth programme at the Legebitra Information Centre. The report is prepared by Tea Hvala. In the second part, Ida will talk to Professor Vesna Leskošek from the Faculty of Social Work about the first national survey on violence in the private sphere and in partner relationships, which she conducted together with the co-authors of the document Mojca Urek and Darja Zaviršek. <p/> On 10 December 2011, a presentation of the short film and the research, which were produced within the framework of the Legebitra Information Centre, took place at the Canteen at the Trough. Both concern the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia and represent a courageous attempt to expose their - sorry, our - invisibility. <p/> The documentary Lesbian Club in Every Village was made by Vesna Vravnik, a filmmaker and lesbian activist, who said that she struggled to find enough female interviewees who were willing to expose themselves on camera. It was particularly difficult for girls and women living in smaller Slovenian towns, where the fear of being judged and isolated is particularly well-founded - which is not to say that the situation in Ljubljana is ideal. When asked why she titled the film ""A Lesbian Club in Every Village"", Vesna replied as follows: <p/> The high school girls who agreed to participate said that the hardest thing to resist is being judged by those who have the most power over them: their parents and teachers. ""We don't expose ourselves at school,"" said a 16-year-old lesbian from Ptuj, ""because we are afraid for our grades. There are quite a few of us, but we are afraid of the older teachers. ""Another added: ""My class teacher called me into her office and told me to choose another school because I had appeared in the Pride Parade - because 'it doesn't go through with them'"". The perplexing question of why she did not sue the homophobic class teacher and the public school that acquiesced to her threat is urgent, but unfortunately also rhetorical. Why? Because we have to wonder again who even dares to seek legal remedies in a country where even the Constitutional Court is homophobic. <p/> With Team Dresch, the legendary lesbian band from the USA, we can sarcastically conclude that lesbians are again and still underground. Which does not mean, of course, that we will not circle a big YES for equality before the law in the referendum. <p/> We continue with the presentation of the extensive research conducted by the Legebitra Information Centre, which last year prepared an anonymous online questionnaire on the situation of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia. Since not much is known about their lives, or ours, they wanted to find out what problems we face, what kind of environment we live in and how (if at all) we shape it. The analysis of the data is not yet complete, so here are just a few excerpts from the presentation at the Canteen at the Trough by Eva Gračanin, Head of Legebitra's Youth Programme. As the concept of ""non-heterosexual women"" is very broad, she first presented the sample of the survey, which included a whole range of gender identities. <p/> The women interviewed were older than those in the film, so it is to be expected that they would have pointed to work, not school, as the most risky environment for coming out. The fact that only 12 of the women came out at work is a testament to the fact that there is a very high chance of losing your job after coming out, or having to ""fire"" yourself because of the pressures. The data on the political participation and social life of LGBT and all other Others was also telling. Eva Gračanin said the following at the presentation: <p/> Perhaps the fear of public exposure and loneliness is easier to understand if we add one more piece of data to the above: only 20% of the women said they felt completely safe in their environment and family circle, and the same percentage of women said their families did not even know about their sexual orientation. More encouraging was the information about trustworthy friends: 60% of the women have such friends. For those women who are not so lucky, we would like to dedicate the song ""Way Out"" by German musician Ellen Allien, and we invite all listeners to listen again in May, when we will focus on a more detailed analysis of Legebitra's survey on the lives of non-heterosexual women in Slovenia. <p/> In the second part of the programme, we spoke to Professor Vesna Leskošek from the Faculty of Social Work about the first national survey on violence in the private sphere and in partner relationships, which she conducted together with the co-authors of the document Mojca Urek and Darja Zaviršek. <p/> To summarise: Violence against women, which according to the above-mentioned data is a very real reality in our society, is therefore the result of deep-rooted chauvinism and patriarchal structures. So please, let no one tell me anymore that feminism is a finished project, that today we can all have our own room if that is what we want! <p/> At the end of the programme, we call on all listeners to declare themselves, to declare their rights, because only then will they be able to demand a public space. The programme was produced by Tea Hvala and Ida Hiršenfelder. We will be back on the air of Radio Student on 11 March, when the Red Dawn will be rising on the horizon.",News

"SLOVNI: Kylie, happy birthday! <p/> 28 May 2014 <p/> We are launching a special section on the Bansi website, featuring both local and foreign celebrities (actors, singers, directors, athletes and others). The feature will be launched by Australian singer, Kylie Minogue, who celebrates her birthday today. <p/> Kylie Minogue was born on 28 May 1968 in Melbourne, Australia. She rose to fame as an actress with her appearance in the Australian soap opera Neighbours. In 1987, she began her active music career in earnest, with her first released song ""Locomotion"" becoming a huge hit. Other tracks on her first album Kylie also became big worldwide hits (you can listen to the album here). <p/> She went on to sign a deal with a group of hugely successful producers, launching her to stardom and worldwide fame. <p/> Locomotion has been sung and danced all over the world. After a career spanning more than 25 years, Kylie is still often singing in concert. In a special classical (orchestral or acoustic) guise, she included it along with 15 others on the album "" The Abbey Road Sessions "". It is an album of her greatest hits, released in 2013, the 25th anniversary of her career. <p/> Kylie is a versatile artist, singer, actress, music video director, songwriter and has had around 6 perfumes released under her name. She is also a huge fashion enthusiast. This photo shows the launch of the book Kylie Fashion, which collects some of her outfits and costumes throughout her 25-year career. The book was published in October 2012. Did you know that Kylie was thinking about becoming a fashion designer when she was in her teens? In an interview, she said that her grandmother taught her how to sew and that fashion means a lot to her. When she started performing, singing and acting on stage completely took over and she was able to successfully integrate her love of fashion into her life. <p/> Kylie was and still is hugely popular throughout her native Australia, Asia, America and of course Europe. She has lived in London since the beginning of her music career, where she is ""literally crazy"", she is extremely popular in France, Spain and is often invited to perform on Italian television. She has already had eleven huge world tours and has performed practically everywhere in the world (Japan, China, Mexico, all over Europe, Asia, Africa, etc.). She has not yet visited Slovenia, although she has many fans here too. What is very interesting about Kylie is that she has never been too shaken by her worldwide fame, e.g. she has lost touch with reality, used illegal substances, been known for some strange affairs, etc. She is always very straightforward in interviews and does not give the impression of being unapproachable or shabby. She is also known for being called "" Cute Kylie "" by her friends, the presenters of the radio shows she regularly appears on, journalists and members of her team. <p/> She also has the characteristic that she "" keeps on recording "". No sooner has she released her "" official studio "" album than she has already released the accompanying singles, which are not included on the album, but her fans quickly find them and these songs also become big hits. To celebrate her 25th anniversary, which she celebrated throughout 2013, she played a total of five concerts in her native Australia (in Melbourne and Sydney) and in the UK (two in London and one in Mancherst), singing her best-known songs for her biggest fans, as well as those that have never been officially released on albums or as singles. The concerts were presented under the title Anti Tour and sold out immediately. <p/>A song that was a huge hit with her fans, yet was never released - Cherry Bomb i from the Anti Tour. <p/> In 2005, in the middle of her big (eighth in a row) Showgirl tour, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which devastated her immensely. Kylie underwent surgery and chemotherapy in Paris at her request. She recovered successfully from the disease and spoke about it very often in interviews, sometimes even crying during them. She returned to the stage with a major concert on 11 November 2006 in her native Australia (Sydney). <p/> Just in those days (26 May 2014), Kylie released a special single called "" Crystallize "", the proceeds of which go to the French cancer foundation Aprec. Kylie is also very often charitable, especially after her illness. <p/> The first single, "" Into the blue "", is from her latest twelfth studio album. <p/> Kylie's first album also features a duet with Jason Donovan. The song "" Especially for you "", which was a huge hit and is still considered one of the most romantic songs today. In this video, Kylie jokes around a bit and sings the song with Kermit the Frog from the Muppet Show. <p/> Kylie was one of the judges on the third series of The Voice (in 2013), a BBC TV show broadcast in London. It's a show that searches for new musical talent. Before that, she had performed in many countries (her native Australia, Italy, America, France, other British shows and more) in just such shows as ""Talent Search"". In this video from 2007, she is seen singing the song ""I believe in you"" with one of the (future) musical talents on the Star Academy show on French TV. Even today, Kylie does not ignore these invitations to appear on talent search shows and appears regularly. <p/> Her extremely extensive Aphrodite World Tour was the singer's eleventh concert tour, organised in promotion of her eleventh album, Aphrodite (2010). The tour took Kylie to Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and North America. This tour was technically of an extremely high standard, with the entire set of songs acting as a sing-dance-theatre show lasting around two hours. Kylie and her extensive team had around 80 concerts scheduled for the tour. The focus of the tour was Kylie as Aphrodite (goddess of love and beauty). The tour lasted from 19 February 2011 to 14 July 2011, almost day after day, with very few days off in between. A recording of the entire concert is also available online. <p/> Another performance from 2008 in one of the shows looking for new musical talent (Star Academy on French TV). Together with Mathieu, they sang one of her biggest hits "" Love At First Sight "". <p/> Anyone who hears Kyie's name is likely to immediately think of the song Kyie jokingly refers to as "" La, la, la "", the first single ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" from her eighth studio album Fever. The song was a hit worldwide and reached number one in more than 40 countries, including the UK, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and many other European countries. It has sold more than 4 million copies. Here we see a presentation of this song from the Brits Awards 2002, where Kylie won the award in the category "" International Female "" (Best Female Artist) in 2002. <p/> Another memorable performance with ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"". The performance received a lot of positive reviews, but it is from the 2011 MTV EMAs (MTV Europe Music Awards). <p/> Appearance on the X Factor in 2010, which is also one of the UK's shows looking for young musical talent. Kylie Minogue's sister, Danii Minogue, was one of the judges on the show. Kylie also made a music video for the song "" Better Than Today "", which she directed herself. <p/> Kylie and Danii Kylie sisters with the song Kids (originally sung by Kylie with Robbie Williams). The clip is from the Showgirl homecoming tour, a concert held in her hometown of Melbourne on 11 December 2006. It was one of Kylie Minogue's first major full-length performances after her treatment and diagnosis. <p/> Either way, Kylie is extremely active and successful. In an interview, she said that diligence is her most recognisable virtue and that she finds inspiration in every single thing. Today she celebrates her 46th birthday. Our editorial team would like to congratulate her.",Opinion/Argumentation

"The opposition SDS party, headed by former Prime Minister Janez Janša, has submitted proposals to Parliament for measures and 5 laws to improve the economic and social crisis. The starting point is the claim ""Slovenia entered the crisis in good shape"", which SDS and J.J. MPs keep repeating. It is true that the period from 2004 to 2008 was a very successful one, both in this country and in the world, but on the other hand, both in the world and in this country, it has been shown that high economic growth and prosperity are based on unrealistic foundations, that a giant inflated bubble has been created which has infamously burst. Slovenia, led by the government of Janez Janša, unfortunately made some big, irreparable mistakes in this ""golden age"", which are plaguing us today in the crisis: Firstly, it did not make the necessary structural changes in any of these favourable times, it did not invest enough in knowledge, research and technological progress. For example, in 2008, the Janša Government allocated a whole million euros for technological and scientific projects in small and medium-sized enterprises; now the figure is already EUR 14 million. Second: In otherwise good times, it has run up huge debts (e.g. motorways were built entirely on credit during this period), it has not reduced the deficit, and what is more, it has even increased it during these fat cow years. Thus, in 2008, gross indebtedness increased by 161 compared with 2004, or from 57% of GDP to 112% of GDP. In order to embellish the balance sheet of your term of office with the accounts, you were prepared to create and trigger a crisis of international proportions because we were not prepared to approve a fictitious budget surplus. The new Government and the crisis that awaited it as soon as it began its work was an empty treasury, nothing, a hole. What is more, the J.J. Government left the new Government full of uncovered bills for pre-election promises that had yet to be found through budget adjustments: money for the extremely damaging public sector wage reform, and thus wage increases that will give us a massive headache, money for student meals, for free nursery schools for the second child ... The previous Government could not have left us a worse bill of goods than yours, Mr Janša. And last but not least, it was the previous Government that allowed and silently monitored the granting of tycoon credits for management takeovers in the so-called state-owned banks NLB and NKBM, which our MEP Vili Trofenik first pointed out, but the information was hidden from him, Minister Bajuk dodged and then disappeared somewhere. Much of the high economic growth was based on credit-financed accelerated construction activity, which also pushed up inflation. Many companies, which were more or less strongly influenced by the state and managed by dedicated personnel close to the government of the day, got into trouble, performed badly and are today on the verge of collapse: Interevropa, Luka Koper, Paloma, Elan, Hit. Not to mention, in particular, the controversial operations at Dravske elektrarne (21 million credit to the Maribor diocese), Eles (financing of Canadian rowers, and Pavlin's Olympics), or the unreasonable decision to build a new building for the Ministry of the Interior, the absurd and excessive purchase of Patrias and a warship, the 200 million increase in the cost of the construction of Block 6 at TEŠ due to the delay in issuing the consent, the inadequate management of the construction of oncology, paediatric and neurological clinics, the new emergency room at the KC ... sad and wasteful stories, which I list with one purpose and one question: do the successors and creators and promoters of all this really have the moral right to criticise, to smarten up, to offer themselves as great saviours? Is it not all just a disguised manoeuvre to divert attention from their own culpability and complicity? The fact is that the previous J.J. Government is unequivocally co-responsible for the difficult situation in which SLO finds itself at the moment. <p/> For a long time, the SDS and the Government of J.J. did not want to and did not acknowledge the crisis that was already prevailing in the world. It was not concerned about the high rise in inflation, which we in Zares, especially our MEP Matej Lahovnik, have been pointing to as the first sign of an unhealthy situation in the economy. Last autumn, you were still saying out loud that there was no crisis in Slovenia and that there would be no crisis, you were doing everything you could to play down the public's predictions of trouble, and you were saying all the time that Slovenia would not be affected by the financial crisis. When the crisis was already here, when experts (e.g. Umar) were already opposing Virjant's public sector wage reform, Virjant was still pushing ahead, and it is precisely this move that has led to the most criticism from the OECD, which is why we are having major problems in the budget. <p/> J.J. said at the Brdo conference on managing the economic crisis a few days ago that the anti-crisis measures of the current Government are ill-advised, those in power do not know what to do, they should rely only on others. Are things really as simple as they are explained by omniscient saviours such as former ministers Vizjak, Grims, Černač ... The whole world is in crisis, the leaders of individual countries are looking for different rescue measures, groping around in the dark, so to speak: some things are proving to be appropriate and effective, others are like a shot in the dark. Even Nobel Prize-winning economists are not unanimous, economists think differently, individual governments look for different ways. Each country has to find its own appropriate way of dealing with the crisis, and in doing so we have to be aware that Slo is not an isolated island, that our economy, which is predominantly an export economy, is influenced by other economies. It is even more true that the resources at our disposal to deal with the crisis are very limited, and we need to think hard about what measures to direct them towards. Is the deliberate and prudent action of the current Government really a harmful delay? Are the measures really unwise, or is it perhaps just a case of recognising that it is really easy for the opposition to propose measures because it does not have to think about global finance, debt, sustainability ... Is it not perhaps just too easy to propose tax cuts and relief in all sorts of areas, while at the same time offering a whole range of 'gifts' such as contributions towards the purchase of housing for young families or a new car - nice, no less. But is it not better to help Revoz and the many manufacturers of parts for the car industry in Slovenia directly than to help the entire global car industry and, in particular, car dealers and car sellers in Slovenia.The Government has prepared a comprehensive response, and we in the Zares Group of MEPs support it. We believe that it has acted appropriately, with the first two packages of measures being prepared primarily to stabilise the financial system, ensure the liquidity of banks and provide funds for the normal operation of businesses. A number of measures were also adopted to ensure better and more efficient absorption of EU funds. The second part of the measures was aimed at preserving jobs, both by encouraging shorter working hours and by encouraging and increasing funds for development investment. The OECD assessed that the measures to help banks were adequate but not yet working. Much can certainly be expected from the guarantee schemes, which have long been blocked because of a veto by the Council of State. In the meantime, 1 500 new companies and 15 000 new jobs have been created with state aid as a result of the measures. We are now facing the coordination and adoption of the measures in the third package. The vast majority of them are generally considered to be good and appropriate. Slovenia needs to find the right mix of measures, given its specificities (e.g. the fact that it generates 70% of its GDP from exports), that will work on the money supply, on the demand for goods and investment and on entrepreneurial activity, but also those that will mitigate the social consequences of the crisis. <p/> A word about the broader dimensions of the SDS and its most exposed members. It is a deliberate action in several directions:first, we are witnessing an increasingly serious and threatening behaviour in the National Assembly, aimed at giving the impression that the functioning of Parliament is anarchic, uncontrollable, full of procedural evasions, procedural gymnastics, creating the impression of an emergency, deliberately prolonged debates, blockages in the work of committees, extraordinary sessions, etc. The Government's performance is portrayed as poor, inadequate, mismanaged, delayed, insufficient, based on internal frictions and inefficiencies. Behind such inflammatory criticism, there is a tacit hope that the Government might lose its compass and stumble into inappropriate and ill-considered solutions that could lead to even greater outrage. But we in the Zares Group of Deputies believe that it is precisely times of crisis that require a lot of talks, coordination, clashing of opinions and concepts of views, social dialogue... In times of crisis, the impression is created that we need a more firm and decisive, authoritative hand, and SDS is already offering it in a certain way. But such a hand can very quickly become a leaden hand. What is happening? People today no longer believe in moderate and reasonable solutions, they are not satisfied with small steps in times of need, they demand quick and radical moves. They are demanding that the guilty be found, that convictions and punishments be handed down, that the scoundrels be dealt with, that there be more order and discipline. And it is not difficult to invite such people, in need and in trouble, into the streets, to goad them against the real and imaginary culprits of their plight, and this is a wonderful warm bed, as Boštjan M. Zupančič says, for various forms of fascism, chauvinism and psychopaths of all kinds. And times of crisis are already known in psychiatry as a paradise for psychopaths. These are already very dangerous matters, which I hope will not be played out in the SLO.In your proposal for measures, you also set out your analysis of the crisis and said that capitalism will emerge from the crisis better, also in value terms, because of its flexibility. A very outdated and ossified mentality. Indeed, many of us are pointing out that economic growth and the model of prosperity that it generates, and that has so far guided global economic growth as a neoliberal and financial model, has not produced good results. It has benefited only a narrow, privileged group, with the rich getting richer and richer, the poor getting poorer and poorer, with capital and ownership privileged and labour deeply undervalued and humiliated and excluded from decision-making. These models were close to your government for most of its mandate (after all, you substantially reduced taxes on the richest, you did not tax wealth) and it was only at the end of your mandate that you started to advocate a social model of the market economy in the light of the forthcoming elections and the poor public image. The current economic growth model is therefore, in our view, socially unjust and, given the limited natural opportunities and goods and the disregard for nature, ecologically unacceptable. Politics also bears a heavy share of the blame for this, as it has been deeply complicit in unethical and immoral behaviour, where power and money have been the only sacred things. Quick money without work. And corruption has become socially acceptable behaviour and the norm. Unfortunately, it has also become rampant in our country and, unfortunately, it has become particularly rampant in recent years, under your government. <p/> Let me conclude my presentation of the Zares Group's views on the measures with a direct assessment of the proposals: <p/> among the measures there are many good, useful and appropriate ones, which the Government will take into account <p/> a whole series of measures that you want to present as your own are merely copied, regurgitated, and are taken verbatim from those already announced and published by the Government <p/> many of the proposed measures are clearly unrealistic, populist, and prepared in order to achieve quick kiss-and-meet-you-good-effects. <p/> While the measures were rejected as inappropriate in the Committee, we would like to stress that, for two reasons in particular <p/> Firstly, as this is only a consideration of the decision that the DZ supports the package of measures, but cannot intervene in their substance, amend or supplement them, the decisions as they stand make it impossible to consider and define each one of them. So in a way: take it or leave it - all or nothing. Is this really what the proposers are saying: that they would like to cooperate and propose to the Government, to help - but their proposal is such that it is virtually untouchable. A very self-important and omniscient move, so to speak. <p/> And secondly: it is an unstoppable and inappropriate method of mixing up normal and established powers between the two branches of government - between the powers that Parliament has and those that the Government has as the executive branch of government. Measures are not merely a matter of setting out a principled direction, but rather of providing concrete guidance for binding action, which is a matter for the Government. The Government must continue to be the policy-maker of the country, which must otherwise be bound by the frameworks set by the National Assembly. What the proponents of the measures are proposing, however, would fundamentally interfere with the role of the Government, even limiting and making it impossible. This, too, suggests that there is, after all, a deliberate dismantling of the three branches of government, as is also indicated by some of the amendments to the Constitution for the Second Republic that are being proposed at the same time. This is already a very dangerous game. That is why we in the Zares Group will not support the measures.",Opinion/Argumentation

"We have several different materials available for solid or masonry construction. You can choose brickwork with improved thermal insulation properties (thermosheet), lightweight blocks made of aerated concrete or expanded polystyrene formwork, the core of which has to be filled with concrete. Their properties, thermal insulation and method of construction are described below. <p/> All of these materials can be used to achieve a thermal transmittance of the whole external wall composition that meets the criteria of low-energy or passive construction. A wall constructed with a higher thermal conductivity material will need to be faced with a thicker layer of thermal insulation to achieve the same or at least a similar effect as a wall constructed with a lower thermal conductivity material. The materials also differ in the way they are constructed and the time taken for the walls to dry, as well as in how or with which additional elements they can be used to facilitate detailing and prevent thermal bridging. <p/> Thermal bricks in different sizes <p/> Bricks with improved thermal insulation properties are available in different shapes and sizes, and are also chosen by builders because they are a natural material. Goriška Brickworks offers thermal bricks 39, 29 and 25 cm thick. The thermal conductivity of the former is 0.22 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of a wall made of them is 0.51 W/m2K. The thermal conductivity of the second and third bricks is 0.24 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of a wall made of 29 cm thick bricks is 0.72 W/m2K and the thermal transmittance of a wall made of 25 cm thick bricks is 0.83 W/m2K. All of them have in common a linearly offset honeycomb and an increased mass of clay per unit volume of brick compared to conventional bricks, says Gregor Malik of Goriška brickworks. The offset honeycomb helps to allow both cold and heat to travel longer into the building, while the mass of the bricks significantly increases heat accumulation and thus helps to better regulate the temperature in the room. <p/> The brickwork does not differ significantly from conventional brickwork, the only difference is the design of the vertical ties, which is made much easier by the pero-utor system. In this case, the mortar is just shaken into the pocketed core that is formed when one brick is brought closer to the other, explains Malik, adding that it does not matter what weather conditions the building is built in. Every bricklayer knows that a period of cold and frost or a strong summer shower is not the best time for quality construction. In winter, the water in mortar can freeze, causing inappropriate reactions in its bonding with the bricks, so that the bonds are weaker than they would be at the right temperatures. In the summer heat, the mortar dries out too quickly due to the heat and the unmoistened bricks. <p/> For thermal insulation of thermo-brick walls, Goriška Brickworks recommends vapour-permeable insulating materials. 12 cm of stone wool on the thickest brickwork achieves a low-energy standard, while 18 cm of the same insulation achieves a passive standard. A 25 cm wall should be lined with 14 cm of stone wool for a low-energy house or 20 cm of stone wool for a passive house. <p/> For a square metre of wall, we will use 20 39 cm thick bricks, 15 29 cm thick bricks and 12.5 25 cm thick bricks. All earthquake-resistant corner and wall elements and the corresponding halves are also available to the builders. <p/> Special adhesive instead of mortar <p/> Wienerberger Opekarna Ormož offers builders of low-energy and passive houses, among other things, thermal masonry in various thicknesses made of ground bricks, using special adhesive instead of mortar, and system solutions for thermal bridges in the vertical and horizontal bond area and lintels with integrated external blinds boxes to facilitate and improve the quality of the detailing. <p/> The passive standard is already achieved with 30 cm thick thermo-walls, which have a thermal conductivity of 0.14 W/mK and must be lined with 20 cm of insulation material with a thermal conductivity of 0.032 W/mK. The thermal transmittance of such a wall is 0.12 W/m2K, says Boštjan Kosec of the Ormož brickworks, adding that the low-energy standard is achieved by lining 30-centimetre-thick bricks with 15 centimetres of polystyrene insulation. <p/> For external walls, vertical earthquake-resistant ties are also used at about four to six metres and at all corners. Additional elements such as corner blocks for the vertical ties and corner blocks to solve the thermal bridge problem in the area of the vertical tie, a system lintel with a box for external blinds, a ceiling system and semi-prefabricated pre-stressed lintels, and insulation elements to insulate the horizontal ties (wreath bricks, wreath formwork) facilitate the masonry work. <p/> The average weight of a cubic metre of external wall is approximately 1 000 kilograms. The time required for brickwork depends on the size of the bricks. For a cubic metre of wall, 85 conventional bricks, 3.7 hours and 220 litres of fresh mortar are needed. For a cubic metre of 30 cm thermo-brick wall, 53 bricks, 3,2 hours and 180 litres of fresh mortar are needed. For a wall of the same size made of brushed thermal bricks, the same number of bricks is needed, but only 1.6 hours and the corresponding amount of polyurethane glue. <p/> Lightweight aerated concrete blocks <p/> Lightweight aerated concrete blocks with improved thermal conductivity can be chosen for the basic structure. The thermal conductivity of 350 kg/m3 blocks is 0.100 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of an external wall made of 40 cm thick blocks (50 cm thick blocks are also available on request) is 0.24 W/m2K. The thermal conductivity of 300 kg/m3 thermoblocks is 0.086 W/mK and the thermal transmittance of a 40 cm wall is 0.21 W/m2K. Both types of thermoblock already meet the requirements of the Energy Efficiency in Buildings Regulations (Pures) without additional thermal insulation, says Nataša Tavčar of Xella porobeton. She says that mortar losses are also important for the thermal insulation performance of a wall, and that they are negligible (less than 4%) in block masonry due to the thin-layer adhesive mortar, which is two to three millimetres thick. <p/> Thin-layer mortar requires precision, which is not difficult if the builder uses the right tools and follows the manufacturer's instructions. It is important that the first course is placed in a mortar that allows the unevenness of the substrate to be eliminated. Thin-set adhesive mortar should be applied with trowels to allow even application. In the following courses, any unevenness that occurs at the joints of the bricks shall be eliminated by the use of a levelling board. Additional elements are available to the builder to facilitate construction and solve thermal bridging problems: type lintels, anti-seismic blocks (for vertical ties) and U- and L-elements (for horizontal and diagonal ties). No additional formwork is needed, which makes construction even faster and ultimately cheaper, Tavčar adds. <p/> The amount of additional insulation depends on how energy-efficient the house is. A single-layer wall meets the Pures requirements for a 35-50 kWh/m2a energy-efficient house. For very good low-energy houses with a consumption below 20 kWh/m2a, an additional 10-14 cm of thermal insulation must be added to the 40 cm brickwork to ensure a thermal transmittance of the wall of 0.16-0.14 W/m2K. The builder can choose mineral thermal insulation boards which, like the blocks, are non-combustible (class A1), vapour permeable, strong, dimensionally stable and easy to shape. For a passive house, the thermal transmittance of the wall must be less than 0.15 W/m2K or, in the case of single-family houses, closer to 0.10 W/m2K. This value is achieved with 40 cm thick blocks and 22 cm of mineral panel insulation. <p/> Despite their large dimensions, porous concrete blocks are relatively easy to work with as they are very light. It takes only 1.71 hours to build a cubic metre of load-bearing wall with 40 cm thick blocks, or 1.92 hours with 30 cm thick blocks. A square metre of wall will take only eight blocks. <p/> Expanded polystyrene cladding <p/> The thermal performance of external walls for low-energy and passive houses can be achieved quite easily with a system consisting of expanded polystyrene elements, the core of which is filled with a concrete core. The certification of the German Passive House Institute confirms the suitability of the system for passive houses, as it allows construction without thermal bridges. The walls are 25 to 40 centimetres thick, the concrete core is 15 to 20 centimetres thick, and the bricks can be bought ready-assembled or assembled themselves using plastic spacers, which also serve as anchors for the reinforcement, says Nataša Jančar of Varčna gradnja. <p/> The thermal conductivity of the brickwork material is 0.029 W/mK, while the thermal transmittance of the wall depends on the thickness of the brickwork - from 0.26 to 0.11 W/m2K, and the acoustic insulation is 44 to 54 dB. Each square metre of wall can hold 0.14 to 0.15 cubic metres of concrete, which means that a square metre of wall weighs between 350 and 400 kilograms, depending on the composition of the concrete and the thickness of the concrete core. <p/> Masonry will be faster if the design takes into account that all the dimensions of the building are divisible by 5 (cm), which means less cutting of the masonry, advises Jančarjeva. Otherwise, all that is needed is precision, care and following the instructions. The walls are concreted at half height, which corresponds to a larger or smaller pear of concrete for a normal-sized storey. The advice on concrete granulation is followed, and the walls are supported before concreting and the concrete is poured slowly, in layers. If the instructions are followed, we will pour flat monolithic walls without air pockets and, above all, we will achieve airtight joints with the reinforced concrete slab and the concrete roof, if we have chosen to do so. <p/> The point of the formwork, says Jančar, is that no additional thermal insulation is needed, as the energy efficiency of the house is already influenced by the choice of brickwork. If we buy the thinnest ones, i.e. 25 cm, we will catch Pures by a hair, but if we choose the thickest ones (40 cm), the house will be very energy-efficient, even passive, with the right siting and good external joinery. <p/> For an average sized house, even one storey per day can be built and watered with good organisation. For one square metre, you need four bricks (25 centimetres high and 100 centimetres long). The use of system elements such as lintels, wreath elements and ceiling and roof elements speeds up the construction process. <p/> Easy as rolling a dice <p/> A system similar to the one described above, which is also certified by the German Passive House Institute, also makes construction quick and easy. It consists of foamed polystyrene formwork elements that are simply placed together and the core is filled with concrete. The system allows for the construction of a building without thermal bridges in four different thicknesses, which are fully compatible with each other and can be combined on the same building, says Alen Mladinov from Arhem - PasivnaGradnja.si. The thermal transmittance of a 31 cm thick external wall is 0.17 W/m2K, the thermal transmittance of a 37 cm thick wall is 0.13 W/m2K and a 43 cm thick wall is 0.10 W/m2K. The last two thicknesses are suitable for passive houses, where no additional thermal insulation is required. <p/>All thicknesses are available with elements that have dried clay on the inside, and construction is facilitated by additional elements with metal connectors, elements without thermal bridges for lintels, ceiling connectors, roller shutter housings, balcony housings, circular corners, vault, external overhanging cantilever, etc. The programme for stairs, ceilings and roof insulation is also suitable for this purpose. <p/> The concrete core can be 15, 20 or 26 cm thick, depending on the structural requirements. One of the advantages of the system is that the entire floor can be constructed and concreted as such. The speed of production per cubic metre depends on the thickness of the elements. For normal buildings, it can take as little as ten minutes. In other words: a storey of a residential house can be built in one day, with all the window openings, spandrels and shutter elements, Mladinov says. For one square metre, we will use five elements.",Information/Explanation

In the autumn of 1997 he went to Rome to the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he completed his post-graduate studies at the Faculty of Church History and received his doctorate in 2002. Then he was a spiritual assistant in Vrhnika (2001 - 2004) and today he works in the parish of Ljubljana - Stožice (2004 -). He is engaged in scientific research and lecturing at the TEOF of the University of Ljubljana and at its Unit in Maribor (assistant 2001, assistant professor 2004). His scientific and research activity is devoted to the field of local church and world history, as well as art history. He also spends a lot of time studying archival material. The results of Ambrožič's scientific research activity are mainly scientific monographs and treatises: - Bell Ringing in Slovenia, AES 15 (1993) - Il ruolo ecclesiastico, culturale e politico di dott. Janez Zlatoust Pogačar (1811-1884), Principe-vescovo di Lubiana, nella storia degli Sloveni, Roma 2002 - The Bishop of Ljubljana, Dr. Janez Zlatoust Pogačar. His religious, cultural and political role in the history of Slovenians, AES 25 (2003) - The parish church of the conversion of St. Paul in Vrhnika, Vrhnika 2002 - The parish church of St. Fabijan and St. Boštjan and St. Jernej in Kočevje and its branches, Kočevje 2003. A semi-scientific approach is also characteristic of Ambrožič's two professional monographs. New bells in the parish church of St Martin, Srednja vas v Bohinju, Ljubljana 2000 and St George and St Lenart in Ligojna, Vrhnika 2004. The most important of his treatises is Die kirchliche Entwicklung nach den politischen Veränderungen (1990) und die heutige Stellung der Kirche, statistische Angaben, Organisation der Kirche (1990) und die heutige Stellung der Kirche, statistische Angaben, Organisation der Kirche), in Die katholische Kirche in Mitteleuropa nach 1945 bis zur Gegenwart (The Catholic Church in Mitteleuropa nach 1945 bis zur Gegenwart), ed. Jan Mikrut, Dom-Verlag, Wien 2006, pp. 531-604, which he wrote as an associate of the Internationales Forschungsinstitut zur Förderung der Kirchengeschichte in Mitteleuropa, Vienna. Associate Professor Matjaž Ambrožič, PhD, is an expert (co-author) in the field of bell- and organ-building, and a writer of expert reports on the restoration and purchase of bells and organs. In the field of bell-ringing he cooperates with the Beratungsausschuß für Deutsche Glockenwesen.",Information/Explanation

"The efficient use of condensing heat is influenced by a number of factors, the main ones being the hydraulic integration of the condensing boiler into the heating system and the temperature of the return water from the heating system. <p/> In low energy houses (NEH) and passive houses (PH), the heating and domestic hot water (DHW) systems are upgraded with solar systems. When designing solar systems, it is important to bear in mind that modern individual components are not a guarantee of good system performance. It is more important that the components are coordinated with each other and optimally integrated into the domestic heating and hot water system. <p/> Today, most houses have a habitable attic, and there is also intensive construction of attic dwellings. However, many loft dwellers dread the summer. It is unbearably hot in their apartments on summer nights. When building a new or adapted attic, you should also ask about the properties of insulation and other materials. This will save not only sleepless nights, but also later expenditure on ventilation and air-conditioning systems, which are not needed if the roof is properly and sufficiently insulated. <p/> The eco-material label is used to describe a product that is characterised by its ability to minimise the impact on the environment throughout its life cycle. In the case of thermal insulation materials, from the point of view of the user, a division between traditional materials and ecological or alternative materials has become established in practice. This division can be partly disputed, since when choosing any insulation material, one must take into account its good qualities, while at the same time taking into account its disadvantages. <p/> Photovoltaic modules, made up of cells connected in series, convert solar energy directly into direct current. The sun's rays fall on the surface of the solar cells and the sun's radiant primary energy is converted into electricity. The transformation is direct, with no intermediate transformation into thermal and mechanical energy. The incident light on the crystal lattice of the selected substance releases an electric charge. In radiation, light quanta - photons - strike the faceplate of the semiconductor and are absorbed. This releases electron pairs, which remain separated due to the internal electric field and thus generate an electric voltage. <p/> The use of geothermal energy (heat from the earth) as a source of energy which, in terms of the quantity of resources, meets the criterion of sustainability, does not increase global radiation due to CO2 emissions when harnessed, and can therefore be considered as a renewable source of energy.",Information/Explanation

"Happy hillbillies at the Philharmonic! <p/> 09 Apr 2012 <p/> There is a lot to learn from all history, including folk-music history. There is only one aspect to this: whether the musician has something to gain from the experience of others, or whether he or she has simply stood still all his or her life. A shining example of how wide one should spread one's wings is the Veseli Hribovci ensemble from Ljubljana. <p/> Veseli hribovci was active for twenty years, led by the academically trained musician Stane Žnuderl, who was usually also the author of the music and lyrics, and who always ensured a high level of performance for those times.The ensemble was extremely popular both in Slovenia and abroad (in the German-speaking area, of course, it was called Die lustigen Bergsteiger), and it also performed in the most important Slovene cultural centres, and it was always in search of the new, the different, the original. Although the Merry Hillmen appeared on the then Radio Ljubljana only in 1959, they had already played two years earlier, but without radio ambitions. The very origins of the ensemble are interesting. They performed the operetta Na planincah naszych (On Our Mountains) at the KUD Vič in Ljubljana, for which the libretto was written by Miha Kunaver and the Veseli hribovci leader Stane Žnuderl wrote the music. When I met him a few times, he always got very angry at such memories, because he could not understand that some radio and television editors, who get their salaries from RTV subscriptions, cannot or will not listen to their listeners. But he also got angry at the idea that there was nothing wrong with local music, it just needed to be brought up to the right level. It was the quality of the music that made the Merry Hills people one of the first to appear on the radio programme Thursday Evening of Local Songs and Hymns, as guests on the first television programmes and on many radio programmes in the field. Back then, it was also the case that the editors of other programmes tried to bring the most popular groups, especially folk-entertainment groups, to the field. Žnuderl was fond of telling anyone who disparaged local music: ""We also performed at the Slovenian Philharmonic, where we - probably one of the few, if not the only ones - played no less than seven polkas and waltzes. And live, in front of the TV cameras. I myself began by whistling the entire first movement of one of my compositions, which created a real enthusiasm among the audience. ""The Merry Mountaineers were among the first to follow the Avseniks across national borders, which were still very closed at that time. In Austria, Germany and Switzerland, they always sang in Slovene. On the other hand, they were so inventive that they performed the song dedicated to the town of Kindberg in both languages and gave the notes to the mayor of the town. Although at that time we were still seen by many as part of the underdeveloped Balkans, this approach convinced everyone and opened the way forward. It is no wonder that the Merry Hillmen recorded 78 songs for German-speaking audiences. And thanks to Žnuderl, they were always among those at home who were looking for a new expression. They were probably the first to add zithers to a quintet in one of their songs, Peter Ambrož, a member of the Slovenian Octet, sang with the Veseli hribovci, and they recorded a large vinyl album with the Stari Ljubljančani, legendary singers, including the Lumbar brothers, members of what were probably the most popular radio singers of the time, the Fantje na vasi (Boys in the Village). To put it another way: Stane Žnuderl never slept on the laurels of his first successes, but always tried to add something new and original to the new ones, and the quintet itself was set up in such a way that it was recognisable from afar. The release of each of their new albums was a great event, as was each public performance. On top of that, the Veseli hribovci from Ljubljana were also good-hearted. They donated a sum that was seven times Žnuderl's professor's salary for the construction of their home in Debele Rtič. It means that all the musicians really had a good heart and that their basic mission was not - as in many cases today - just to make sure that they performed as much as possible for the sake of earning money, everything else being of secondary importance.",Opinion/Argumentation
"For a person in pain, we think first about what caused the pain, and then about how to alleviate it. Pain is indicative of origin and cause, but rarely is it so characteristic that it suggests a definitive diagnosis in itself. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the accompanying information about how you feel, the surrounding circumstances and the findings on examination and further investigations. <p/> 1. <p/> When something hurts, something is wrong <p/> Pain is often indicative of its origin and cause by its site of occurrence, its characteristics and the accompanying changes in the affected body part. Thus, a sore throat may be accompanied by redness of the pharynx, a sore elbow by a painful movement in a certain direction, a painful pressure on a certain spot near the joint. Painful spasms under the right rib arch after a fatty meal... So, when we think of the above-mentioned pains, we will think of sore throat, of prolonged overstrain of the muscles of the forearm, of gallstones... For most pain patients, these are unpleasant sensations caused by the activation of pain receptors in the tissues. These receptors are found in the skin, mucous membranes, connective tissue, muscles, the popliteum and in the walls of internal organs (and in many places they are absent - for example, in the brain! Injury or damage to tissue releases so-called ""pain-inducing substances"" that act on pain receptors. This results in so-called nociceptive pain. This can be further divided into visceral (when the internal organs are affected - the pain will typically be in the form of painful 'spasms' - colic) and somatic (this is typically tearing and/or throbbing). When something hurts, something is wrong. Our everyday experience therefore equates pain with tissue damage or failure. When we miss a nail with a hammer and hit our thumb nail, the pain can be very severe, but we know the cause and are not frightened because we know that it is not serious and will pass quickly. When it hurts and the cause is not clear, fears arise. These can disturb our peace of mind much more than, for example, a ""chest prick"" for its own sake. That's why we want to explore pain. People choose to see a doctor more often and sooner because of pain (or other unpleasant body sensations) than because of a (painless) disturbance in a bodily function. Somehow they feel that if it doesn't hurt, it can't be worse. But if it hurts ... didn't the neighbour who was complaining of pain in his fingers have a heart attack? Didn't a colleague in the company have a sudden severe headache and bleeding in her head, but hasn't been back to work since? <p/> EXAMINE THE PAIN <p/> So, when there is pain, there is a need to see a doctor and there is a need to examine the pain. And how will the doctor proceed? In the case of a patient with pain, he or she first thinks about what caused the pain, and then about how to relieve it. Pain may give clues to its origin and cause - but it is rarely so characteristic that it suggests a definitive diagnosis in itself. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the accompanying information about how you feel, the surrounding circumstances and the findings on examination and further investigations. It then treats the cause of the pain, and if the pain is relieved while the treatment of the cause takes longer, it treats the pain itself. (As we say, it treats ""symptomatically"" - symptomatic treatment is that which relieves the symptom, in this case the pain - but it does not treat the cause). Since pain is a subjective experience, it is from the patient that the doctor will learn most about pain (as well as other sensory abnormalities). When the patient does not provide all the information himself, he will make further targeted enquiries, especially if he has already formed a ""working diagnosis"" (hypothesis) of what the patient's pain is ""supposed"" to mean. In order to be able to direct the examination and investigations on the basis of the pain and to arrive at a definitive diagnosis, the doctor will collect information on the site of the pain, the nature of the pain (including its duration), the circumstances of the pain, the factors that amplify the pain and the factors that mitigate it. Of course, he or she will also be interested in any other information that is usually collected when talking to the patient (so-called ""history taking""). When the pain is sufficiently characteristic or accompanied by data to guide examination and investigations, the method described above will suffice. The examination process will be fairly straightforward and will not take much time. However, even in such a patient, it is often useful to measure the pain further. In a very simple way, we can assess it in the patient's own words: even with a basic record, we will define the pain in terms of intensity as mild, moderate, severe, very severe. It is also useful to note how much inconvenience it causes the subject (how it interferes with daily activities, how it disturbs sleep). Additionally - and still simply - we measure it using the so-called visual analogue scale: the subject marks the spot corresponding to the intensity of his pain on a 10 cm long straight line, bordered on the left by 0 and on the right by 10 (meaning either a state of no pain at all - 0, or a state of the worst possible pain - 10). By then measuring the marked spot (for example on a 10 cm line), a numerical indication of pain is obtained (for example 5, 5). This information is recorded in the report and will later be used to measure more precise pain intensity than just ""moderate pain"". If the patient scores the pain as 3 at the follow-up examination, we will get the impression that the pain is milder, although the patient will still self-report it as 'moderate'. Of course, a similar analogue scale can also be used to measure other inconveniences that accompany pain (e.g. how much the pain interferes with his/her social activities). In cases of chronic pain, it is useful to spend more time analysing it and to give the patient a questionnaire to fill in (this can also be completed in the waiting room). For example, such a questionnaire has been developed by colleagues at the Slovenian Association for the Treatment of Pain (Slovenian version of the Brief Pain Inventory, developed by Cleeland). Although psychological and social aspects may be present to some extent in any pain, these are explored in greater depth in chronic pain, or when the cause of the pain is not clear or seems disproportionate to the cause. All pain is perceived by the nervous system or the brain. Nerve connections carry pain information from the affected area to the brain. However, pain can also be caused by a defect in the sensory nervous system, in which case we speak of neuropathic pain. (In this context, the term 'neuropathic' is used in the broadest sense and means a nervous system defect. This should be explained because the term neuropathy is used in medicine to refer specifically to an affection of the so-called peripheral nerves. Neuropathic pain', on the other hand, refers to all pain arising from nerve damage or dysfunction, whether peripheral or central nervous system. ) When neuropathic pain is suspected, we ask targeted, detailed questions about the various accompanying neurological symptoms (such as tingling, burning, hot, cold and other unusual sensations at or near the painful site), as well as about possible additional disturbances of various other nerve functions. In short, a patient with suspected neuropathic pain will be questioned and examined differently from a patient with ""normal"", i.e. nociceptive pain. <p/> CLINICAL EXAMINATION <p/> In the case of suspected nociceptive pain, we orientate ourselves to the affected part of the body and examine it closely (otherwise we perform a general and local physical examination, which - depending on the pain - is oriented ""internal"", ""surgical"", ""orthopaedic"", etc.). In the case of suspected neuropathic pain, we focus on the ""neurological"" examination. While this includes the examination of many neurological functions, the most important part of the examination in pain is the examination of skin and mucous membrane tenderness. This examination is seemingly simple, but it is actually one of the most challenging elements of the neurological examination, both for the examiner and for the subject. In the sensitivity examination, we first look for areas of the body that are insensitive to particular qualities of sensation (to fine touch, to pain, to cold, to warm, to vibration, to joint position). We then compare whether, in different anatomically defined areas of the body, the subject feels these qualities normally or in the same way as in the area he/she describes as normally sensitive. In short, in this second part of the investigation, we try to determine the extent of the decrease in sensitivity in a particular anatomical arrangement. The anatomical distribution of the sensitivity disturbance indicates the nervous structure affected, with a particular nerve animating a different area of skin and mucous membranes than a single nerve root; in spinal cord involvement, again, the distribution is different; and in brain involvement, it is also characteristically distributed. It is, in short, the ""failure pattern"" that tells us a lot about which nerve structure is affected. Since there are many different ""dropout patterns"", practically all of them cannot be tested without completely ""tiring"" the subject, so an experienced investigator needs to create a working diagnosis (or a short ""list"" of the most likely diagnoses) on the basis of the information he or she gets from talking to the patient, in order to be able to investigate in a targeted way. In addition to the anatomical distribution of the sensitivity loss, we are also interested in the severity of the lesion. The quantitative extent of the sensitivity change can, of course, only be roughly defined by clinical examination (mild, moderate or extensive loss). When we investigate sensitivity in a patient with neuropathic pain, we will often be alerted to the fact that a mild stimulus is already felt as distinctly unpleasant, painful (this is allodynia). This patient will often go on to say that he or she feels a mild pain stimulus (for example, a light prick with a pinprick) as distinctly painful, and the pain may persist when the stimulus is no longer there (this phenomenon is called hyperalgesia and hyperpathia). In patients with suspected neuropathic pain, we therefore specifically investigate whether allodynia and hyperalgesia are also present and, in addition to sensitivity to a static stimulus (pressure), we also investigate sensitivity to a moving stimulus (swiping with a cotton wool pad or brush). This sensitivity is not exclusively found in patients with neuropathic pain, but is less common in other pain conditions. The clinical examination of a patient with suspected neuropathic pain is quite extensive and demanding. This is why experts are trying to be more successful with a more targeted approach, which would be more manageable by a larger number of experts. French researchers have published a very promising short questionnaire (DN4) that can be used to discriminate well certain neuropathic pain syndromes. <p/> TECHNICAL TOOLS <p/> The sense of fine touch is orientation tested by a light touch with the finger, for a lighter touch a piece of cotton wool should be used. Good quantification of fine touch is possible with von Frey hair sticks (calibrated nylon filaments on a handle - ""monofilaments""). This method is particularly useful for studies where we want to have a completely standardised procedure. In Slovenia, hairpin testing has become established especially in the standardised screening of diabetics at risk of peripheral nerve involvement (diabetic polyneuropathy). For pain testing, we use a pumice stone (which is discarded after use! ) or a sharp broken wooden stick. The sensation of cold can be tested roughly by touching areas of skin with solid metal objects, or traditionally with a test tube filled with cold water. The sense of warmth is tested with a test tube filled with warm water. The sense of vibration is tested with a tuning fork. This sensation can be partially quantified with a special musical fork that has a scale to monitor the intensity of the vibration. When testing joint position sensation, we do not use any aids to assess the subject's sense of the position of a stationary joint and the subject's recognition of the direction of movement of the joint (as a rule, we mainly test the movement of the joints in the toes). Quantitative sensory testing has established itself as an important adjunct to the clinical examination, as it can provide quantitative and modality-specific information about the sensory impairment. Techniques are known to quantify mechanical sensation, thermal sensation and electrical stimulus detection. All of these methods are also used, at least in some places, for routine diagnostic purposes, but are, for the time being, of particular relevance to research work. The principle of these methods is to determine the threshold of sensitivity for a particular quality of sensation and, of course, the threshold of pain for a particular modality of sensation (pressure, hot, cold, etc.). Quantitative sensory testing is a ""psychophysical"" examination The tests require an alert, attentive and well-cooperative subject who understands the instructions well. We have already mentioned that touch sensitivity can be quantified by von Frey hair. These nylon filaments can also be used to determine the area of hypersensitivity (hyperalgesia) to point stimuli in a patient with neuropathic pain. Thicker filaments also irritate pain receptors in the skin and can be used to determine the threshold for mechanical pain. Quantified testing of hot and cold sensation is done with special thermodes that are placed on a specific part of the body and adjusted to develop a specific temperature. In patients with suspected neuropathic pain, we mainly use the method of determining the threshold of sensation. Patients with neuropathic pain often report paradoxical sensations (for example, feeling a very cold object as 'hot'). The sensation of vibration can be quantitatively assessed using vibrameters, i.e. an electromechanical device with a handpiece that has an adjustable amplitude of displacement, while applying standardised pressure to the skin. The vibrometer is used to determine the vibration detection threshold and the vibration decay threshold. In a subject with pain and suspected peripheral nerve impairment, electrophysiological methods can be used to define the impairment more precisely. The methods used are electromyography (measuring the electrical activity of muscles) and electroneurography (measuring the electrical responsiveness of nerves). A significant limitation of these methods is that they are only sensitive to abnormalities of the thicker and myelinated nerve fibres. Neuropathic pain arises particularly in the case of thin nerve fibre defects, which are not investigated by routine electrophysiological methods. In central nervous system disorders, other electrophysiological methods (measurement of sensory and motor evoked potentials) will only exceptionally contribute to a more accurate anatomical diagnosis. Therefore, in the diagnosis of central nervous system disorders, we prefer to use imaging methods, which are also useful in the diagnosis of peripheral nervous system disorders, depending on the suspected location of the lesions or lesions. At the level of pain experience, there are interactions between several nervous subsystems, as shown by studies using functional brain imaging methods. These can track changes in brain activity during the experience of pain. (PET and functional MRI methods are currently used in the investigation of pain for research purposes only. ) Especially in chronic pain syndromes, the investigation and evaluation of the psychological and social dimensions of chronic pain are necessary, but a detailed description is beyond the scope of this paper. As nociceptive pain is treated differently from neuropathic pain, pain needs to be diagnosed accordingly. In neuropathic pain, we can expect better treatment success if we can differentiate between the different pain syndromes, not only in terms of the cause, but also in terms of the nature of the disorder. It seems important to distinguish between disorders with provoked pain and those with spontaneous pain. Stimulus-evoked pain can be more accurately defined by more in-depth sensory testing (especially quantitative sensory testing). While such a more precise definition of pain does not yet have a very clear impact on treatment decisions, it is hoped that a more precise definition of patients into those with dynamic hyperalgesia, static hyperalgesia and allodynia, respectively, will adequately identify specific subgroups for which we will soon be able to select appropriately targeted drugs. For the time being, a comprehensive patient interview and physical examination are an adequate basis for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain syndromes and for the follow-up of the patient during treatment. However, the management of more complex chronic pain conditions in patients usually requires a team approach to both diagnosis and treatment.",Information/Explanation

"That the Minister of the Environment and Spatial Planning, Andrej Vizjak, decided to deny our publication on Saturday morning via the twitter profile of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning of the information circulating about his (possible) resignation due to the fiasco of the water referendum ... <p/> ... but not himself, personally, as Minister Vizjak, since his possible departure from the ministerial office is not a matter of a decision of the ministry, but of the Prime Minister and the SDS party, suggests at least two things: <p/> - The minister's (admittedly justified) nervousness ... <p/> - ... and the fact that the quiet behind-the-scenes battle (for) Minister Vizjak is far from over. <p/> Meanwhile, it is worth noting the following: within the SDS party, it is increasingly being realised that Vizjak is no longer the minister from the second Janša government and that Vizjak is now even being meaningfully defended by individual members of Odlazko's political media on the grounds that Vizjak is ""Too Big to Fail"", which is not unexpected either. It is a logical consequence of the fact that Odlazek's media was taken into ownership some time ago <p/> When the political scene smelled a bit of Tanja Fajon - as a possible prime minister (here), Sebastjan Selan, former director of the SOVA during Pahor's government, has already appeared, then director of Petan's flagship companies, the now-sold Marina Portorož and the not-yet-sold Terme Čatež, also allegedly involved in the secret filming of Minister Zdravko Počivalšek during the mask affair (source), when Selan himself made a quick buck selling protective medical equipment during the first wave of the epidemic of Covida-19. Selan has long been considered a silent and publicly unacknowledged advisor to Fajon and, according to our sources within the SD, has already started recruiting (read: promising posts and positions ""when we come to power""), and in doing so, of course - quite expectedly for those who are more familiar with the situation in the party - he has bumped into the SD Secretary General Dejan Levanič and another behind-the-scenes SD recruiter, former SD Director General Uroš Jauševec. <p/> Today and tomorrow, including the days after Sunday's water referendum, are indeed thunder days for the Janez Janša government. After the referendum fiasco and the opposition's threats of a new constructive no-confidence motion, three extremely important votes of the National Assembly are scheduled today and tomorrow, when the government will need at least 45 and even 46 votes: <p/> - Today's vote on the demographic fund <p/> - And (tomorrow's) re-vote on the amendment to the law on infectious diseases, and the vote on the election of a new Minister for Digitalisation - Marko Boris Andrijanič (NSi). <p/> Because if all these votes fall, the Janša government will be seriously shaken, maybe even fall (well, the government representatives assure internally that they have the votes of the MPs guaranteed), which would most probably be followed by early elections. If these laws and Andrijanič do not fall, it almost 100% means that this government will last until the regular parliamentary elections next year...

"IAC and the Coggins test <p/> For those of you who take your horse to competitions, shows or other events where large numbers of horses gather, you will have heard of IAC. An IAC test is usually required to enter competitions, and sometimes to transport horses to a new stable, when a horse changes ownership... <p/> But do you know what the acronym IAC stands for, and why it is so important to have a test to prove that a horse is not infected? <p/> Introduction IAC is an acronym for I nfectious a nemio k onj, a viral disease that is in many ways related to the disease known as AIDS. <p/> In both cases, it is a viral disease for which there is neither a vaccine nor a cure. Although most infected horses quickly succumb to the disease, a small percentage of affected horses make at least a semblance of a recovery, but these same horses still carry the virus and become ill again when they are subjected to greater strain or stress. It is precisely because some horses look healthy despite carrying the virus that testing is needed to show the true picture of the horse's health. This also ensures the safety of all horses in the same stable, in the same pasture ... <p/> Transmission Recently, research has revealed new findings in the field of transmission of this disease. The disease is mainly transmitted by blood-sucking insects (hookworms, flies, mosquitoes ... ). For example, if an infected horse is bitten by an adder and then by a healthy horse, the disease is transmitted from one to the other. The virus only survives in the mealworm for a short time (15-30 minutes), so the disease is usually spread between horses that are housed close to each other, e.g. in the same stable or pasture. The disease occurs wherever horses and bloodsucking insects are present. <p/> Clinical signs In equine infectious anaemia, there are three groups of symptoms: acute symptoms, chronic symptoms and latent carrier symptoms, which are barely noticeable or absent. <p/>Acute symptoms include fever, listlessness, lack of running. It is difficult to diagnose an acute horse as the symptoms are generalised and the IAC test will not be positive for a month and a half after infection. About one third of infected horses with acute signs die within a month. <p/> Chronic symptoms include recurrent short acute periods with weight loss, swollen abdomen and legs and anaemia. The horses will test positive for IAC. In this condition, the horse may last for several years before the disease finally debilitates it. <p/> Most asymptomatic infected horses will show no recognisable signs of infection but will test positive on the Coggins test. <p/> Coggins test To ensure that a horse is not carrying the IAC virus, a simple test called the Coggins test is performed. This test checks whether antibodies to IAC are present in the horse's blood. Blood samples must be examined by an authorised laboratory. This test is often needed at competitions and transport events and is the simplest way of proving that your horse is healthy and is not a threat to the health of other horses at the event. <p/> Once you have passed the Coggins test, there is no need to repeat it just to keep calm. Your horse will not be IAC positive unless it shows serious signs of illness after contact with another horse whose IAC status you do not know. Further IAC tests should only be carried out for the purposes of the situations described above (competitions, shows, transport... ). <p/> Prevention With the blood testing programme and the required tests at major events, the number of cases of infection has been drastically reduced. When the testing programme started, it was believed that this approach would even eradicate the disease completely, but there are just so many asymptomatic carriers each year that the disease still occurs. There is no vaccine for IAC. It is therefore important to ensure that your horse and the horses it comes into contact with are tested and that they test negative. More and more horse boarding providers are requiring an IAC test for all newly arrived horses, which certainly goes a long way in preventing the spread of the disease. If you have horses in your care in stables or on pasture, require an IAC test from all new horses coming into your care. <p/> One more piece of information for anyone interested in having an IAC test: the Coggins test is carried out at the Equine Veterinary Clinic in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the price of the rapid test (results in one day) is €25, while the normal test (results in six days) costs a little less. The IAK test is valid for one year in Slovenia. <p/>Shops and services",Information/Explanation

"PEGAN, Vanja <p/> My parents Edita and my father Leander Pegan came to Piran, the birthplace of my father's mother, in the autumn of 1963. Both were teachers, my mother a class teacher at the Piran primary school, my father a brass and woodwind player at the music school, and also a brass band chaplain. In 1965 their daughter Katja was born and a year and a half later their son Vanja was born. <p/> He attended primary and music school in Piran, social science grammar school in Koper, and studied comparative literature in Ljubljana. Between 1989 and 1996 he taught classical guitar and musicology at the Music School in Sežana and Komno, and composed incidental music for theatre productions at the Primorska Drama Theatre (The Egg, The Runaway Robot, Vida Grant, The Miraculous Stone, The Little Prince), the Ljubljana City Theatre (Audition, Pahljača), the Cankarjev dom and the Helios Theatre (Brigades of Beauty) and the Glej Theatre (Don Lorenzo). <p/> He started writing as a high school student. He was also editor of the high school literary newsletter Ogledalo. He finally chose his career as a writer in 1996 and has since been teaching guitar on a part-time basis at the Comunità degli Italiani ""Giuseppe Tartini"" di Pirano (Community of Italians ""Giuseppe Tartini"" of Pirano). In 2002 he became a member of the Association of Primorska Literary Writers. In 2003 he obtained the status of a self-employed writer in culture. <p/> He writes for children and adults. In collaboration with the academic painter Fulvia Zudič, he has published the picture books Citronček in Giovanin, Mesto 2000 and Tonin. All three are multilingual. The first was awarded the 3rd International Competition for Original Illustrated Fairy Tales in Bordano, Italy (1999). Tonin was selected by the Internationale Jugendbibliothek in Munich as one of the best international children's and young people's books in 2010, and was included in the exhibition and catalogue. Tonin's picture book was thus awarded the prestigious title/prize The White Ravens 2010. He has also written the plays The Three Little Donkeys and Rosie the Shrimp and Lučka and the Most Beautiful Gift for children. Both have had several stage productions and have toured at home and abroad. <p/> He first captivated adults with his collection of short stories, Sailors' Bathing in Warm Water. This was followed by the novels The Boat and The Writer, Adam and the Pilot, then the short stories in the book The Sky of a Long Summer, the novel Journey to the Beginning of the Road and the short stories collected under the title Four Sea Miles. <p/> The publication of Pegan's books never goes unnoticed by readers, reviewers and literary critics. He put Piran and the Slovenian sea on the Slovenian literary map. ""With Pegan's fiction, the sea and the seaside town enter Slovenian literature as never before"". (Tucovič V., 2010) ""His writing style is subtle, incisive and confessional, or in other words, Vanja's writing is colourful, melodic and poetic. What he feels, he can articulate. He is a master of describing details and interesting phrases, of interweaving past and present, of nostalgia and optimism. Reading his works carefully, one cannot fail to notice his subtle criticism of the absurd values of today's society and his awareness that we need something more than mere materialism and consumerism to live a meaningful life."" (Petaros Kmetec K., Juh M., 2012) <p/> He has published in various literary magazines. Since 2009, Vanja Pegan has been the president and co-founder of the literary association and publishing house Društvo Knjižni krog.",Information/Explanation

The solution is HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound), a treatment that uses focused high-intensity ultrasound technology to heat tissue at a specific depth with extreme, surgical precision, resulting in a direct lifting effect. It is the world's first wrinkle smoother, and depending on the depth of the wrinkle, it is possible to lift the eyelids by 3-4 mm, reduce the pores on the face, firm and lift cheekbones, etc. However, in cases where the eyelid is drooping due to nerve damage or is congenital, the device cannot achieve the changes and surgery is required. Even very pronounced under-eye bags can be reduced, but they cannot be completely eliminated with one treatment. <p/> The excellent results of the HIFU treatment cannot be achieved with any other device or treatment, nor with radiofrequency, mesotherapy or dermapen. However, realistic expectations are necessary, because the kind of taut face you see on Hollywood celebrities is the result of expensive surgical procedures, without which such extreme results cannot be achieved. <p/> The HIFU treatment is performed by a trained beautician who also provides training on this treatment for beauty salons throughout Croatia. So far, she has ""beautified"" more than 150 women from Croatia and Slovenia, so you too can find out why it is worth visiting the Tajna ljepote salon for facial rejuvenation. <p/> This revolutionary and unique device can: completely remove forehead wrinkles, lift eyebrows by 3-4 mm (by lifting the upper eyelids), soften or completely remove wrinkles around the eyes, soften or completely remove under-eye bags, tighten enlarged pores, firm and lift cheekbones, soften or completely remove nasolabial folds and nasolabial folds between the nose and the lip, tighten the skin of the neck, tighten and remove the chin, tighten the skin of the décolletage. <p/> Ultrasound Rejuvenation Treatment High-intensity ultrasound generates large amounts of collagen. After the treatment, the skin is not damaged and does not require recovery. <p/> A single HIFU rejuvenation treatment is enough for great results!",Promotion

"Racist assault <p/> Man charged with attempted murder for alleged self-defence <p/> Almonte, a Dominican, was in the wrong place at the wrong time on 26 March. Shortly before midnight, he was attacked by three shaved heads in the Domžale bar Pri Jurčku. It was allegedly a racist attack. According to the reader's testimony, the young men waited until the stranger was alone and then attacked him from behind. In order to defend himself against the kicks and punches, the attacked man crouched down and then swung a knife at the thugs. He cut two of them and ran away, but then surrendered to the police. <p/> Although this was a reaction in self-defence, the police then only charged the Dominican. Not those who allegedly ""struck first"". Since the end of March, Almonte has been in custody, which has already been extended once, as the court had to hear several witnesses and appoint a medical expert for three people, the Ljubljana District Court explained. The case file, which will be handed over to the prosecutor's office, accuses him of two counts of attempted manslaughter, which carries a sentence of five to 15 years in prison. After all the interrogations they have conducted, they believe that the Dominican man came after the Slovenians, not the other way around, and that he used the knife with the intention of killing them. But this is probably not the whole truth. The racist shaved heads allegedly threatened the witnesses of the incident: if they exposed themselves, they would retaliate, the reader wrote. The investigation therefore probably did not cover everyone who saw the incident. Only those who testified in defence of the attackers were exposed. We tried to verify this, but the court refused to grant us access to the file because the case is still pending. <p/> ""I would like to point out that racism exists in this country and is a very serious problem. Intolerance is only escalating - to oppression, hostility, hate speech, physical violence. These things are very present and very dangerous and no one is doing anything about it,"" the reader wrote, further hammering on the conscience of eyewitnesses to overcome their fear and help the court get to the truth.",News
"Culture &gt; A moth's lunch <p/> No doubt, this is the show of a bookishly moody moth who will be thinking that today. He's been offered a slice of classic Australian literature to digest, from the pen of David Malouf, the multi-award-winning kangaroo, fiction writer, poet and novelist. The novel in question, An Imaginary Life, is one of the so-called postcolonial reads... <p/> To a random chimp like myself, it is easy to believe that the human imagination knows no bounds. Imagine, then, whose skin you would jump into, where you would fly to, if your thoughts did not keep crashing into the walls of reality. It would be nice to be a chicken in a world without a poultry industry, or a mediocre chair, immune to the jaws of a leech and the embrace of neurotically sweaty buttocks... maybe a piece of still-warm, newly born faeces... Imagine how popular they would be with the flies. What we would all be if our minds could defy change and not reflect shadows. The shadows of the moratorium of a postadolescence that persistently doubts. <p/> No doubt, this is the submission of a bookishly moody moth who will fancy that this is what it is today. He's been offered a slice of classic Australian literature to digest, from the pen of David Malouf, the multi-award-winning kangaroo, fiction writer, poet and novelist. The novel in question, An Imaginary Life, is one of the so-called postcolonial reads. The motif of the ascetic who ventures across a vast, mostly inhospitable landscape to find himself in the isolation of isolation is a frequent one in Australian literature. This motif has, in fact, developed into a national mythology, and has thus helped to shape Australian cultural identity, certainly among the white, immigrant population. Aborigines have an ascetic for lunch, just as Australians have kangaroos. <p/> Anyway, in The Imaginary Life we are placed in ancient times, in the shoes of the witty Roman poet Ovid, who is no ordinary, voluntary ascetic. We know from glimpses of his real life that he was the celebrated author of the Metamorphoses, a poet who knew how to articulate most beautifully the lazy decadence of his time, a man who not only moved in the heartland but was the very heart of Roman high society. And the heart is that missing part of the human toolbox which the then Emperor Augustus forgot when, for reasons unknown to us, he had Ovid exiled to the very edge of the Roman Empire, to an emergency civilised barbarian settlement. The unfortunate poet was left without bread, without games. And for him, the fiction is just beginning. <p/> In the emptiness of the desert landscape, Ovid of Maloof finds himself in profound silence, for Latin is not the barbarians' personal hygiene. The saddened poet is left with no choice but to put on his hair, roll in shit and surrender to the unbearability of silence. At this point, we find ourselves in the framework of a colonial discourse, which is expressed through the absence of a familiar environment, language and, consequently, an unresolved identity. <p/> The author thus focuses on the mental aporias and inner conflicts of the protagonist rather than on a narrative description of his surroundings. Here, however, the novel's multilayered nature gradually comes to the fore, leaving its central motif open to a multitude of interpretations. Is An Imaginary Life a novel about the search for identity and the importance of language in shaping it, a poetic reflection on the nature of life and death, on transcending boundaries in the landscape and in ourselves, on maturing through relationships with others? It leaves the layers of meaning to the horizon of imagination and thinking beyond the anxieties of civilisation. <p/> The cynicism of the cultivated poet Ovid, however, begins to diminish when he encounters the Child, a wild boy from the nearby forest. The little unsocialised hairy creature, who croaks, howls and generally disregards the behavioural patterns of the proudly standing specimens of modern homo sapiens, gradually reveals to him that civilisation is not an incurable disease. The story ends in an embrace of existentialist kitsch and pantheistic idealisations about nature. Flower children will thus be thrilled to read Imaginary Life. Lonely cowboys will be enlightened. Friends of trees will sprout leaves instead of hair. You'll want to ask a praying mantis out on a date.",Review

"While enjoying a stroll through the colourful streets of Burano at the end of April, I was interrupted by a telephone call from Stojan asking 'Hi, Momak. Would you like to go to Mont Blanc? "" Although it was already warm in summer, I froze for a moment. My answer was yes. An old holiday must be made the most of. If it is an active one, so much the better. <p/> After all the coordination, Polona, Stojan and I are finally part of a mini-team that monitors the weather forecast over Shamonix and gathers information on a daily basis. On Monday, we make a quick decision to leave on the morning of Tuesday 13 May... from rainy Ljubljana. We set off for Italy, past Venice, Milan, towards Aosta and through the tunnel under Mont Blanc to Chamonix. On the way, we have a coffee on the Italian autostrada with Klemen, who is going to the same places on business as a mountain guide. <p/> In the evening we arrive in a still cloudy town under snow-capped peaks. You can't see the peaks, but you can feel the cold of the glaciers. <p/> In the evening we are in the same hostel as Klemen Gričar and Tomaž Jakofčič, ""gasterbajters"" with a lot of experience up there. They give us selfless advice and answer all our questions. <p/> Our original plan was to take the gondola on Wednesday to the Aiguille di midi, 3842 metres high, from where we would ski down the Vallee Blanche and do a tour to the Torino hut, where we would spend the night. On Thursday, the plan was to ski down the Valee Blanche to Montevers and then take the cog railway back to Chamonix. <p/> On Friday we planned to ride again to the Aiguille di midi mid station, and from there climb up to the Gran Mulets hut, and on Saturday night start for the summit. The weather forecast for Saturday was also promising. <p/> Polona, at the suggestion of Klemena, checked the reservation at the Gran Mulets hut and was informed that we had a reservation from Thursday to Friday. Apparently the dec up there had written the date wrong when the first booking was made. <p/> The combination of days, times, reservations starts. In the end, we come to the conclusion that we will climb up to the Torino hut on Wednesday, descend into the valley on Thursday and immediately climb back up and to the Gran Mulet hut. Well, the plan is one thing, the reality is another. <p/> When we arrive at the Aiguille di Midi lookout, we do not even get a panoramic view, let alone the conditions for skiing on glaciers covered with 30 cm of fresh snow. Fog and clouds obscure the peaks and descend to the valley. This time the weathermen have kicked the darkness. <p/> This is this from the acclimatisation tour. Unfortunately, we descended to the valley by gondola. <p/> On Thursday we finally wake up to a clear morning. <p/> We take the gondola up to 2,310 m, to the Plan de l'Aiguille, and from there ski under the north face of the Aiguille de midi towards the Gran Mulets hut. <p/> Soon, the full majesty of the mountains and glaciers is revealed. <p/> The sun is already warming up strongly, but the ice sculptures are still mighty. <p/> Before crossing the Bosson at the Jonction section, we take narrow bridges over glacial crevasses to reach the flank below the Gran Mulets hut, which stands on top of a rocky ridge. <p/> From here, the Aiguille di midi is visible from the other side, with Chamonix below. <p/> On the other side of the flank, icebergs glisten in the sun. <p/> At the bottom of the hut, we take off our skis and follow the carved path up to the hut, chain and rope in tow. <p/> In the hut, we settle into our shared beds and wait for dinner. While we wait, I do a few laps around the house... <p/> Next to the hut is a building which, if it had water in it, could be called a toilet. So it can only be called a ""shithole"" with a capital R, as the ""septic tank"" is down there on a glacier somewhere. <p/> Prayer flags colour the day. <p/> The sun slowly goes to rest, and up here the real show of light and colour begins. First, the snow expanses take on a whole new hue with soft shadows... <p/> The wind doesn't let up up there. <p/> A ball of fire will slowly hide under the clouds. <p/> The permafrost under the hut ensures a constant climate. <p/> And it's... day. My 44th , ... birthday. It was beautiful. <p/> When the sun hadn't even set, we were all in bed ... by 3am. Then up, breakfast, a night descent along the chain and rope to the snow below the hut and a start in the glare of headlamps to the summit. <p/> We walk in the dark on the groomed spur for a good while before the day begins to wake up. The lights are still burning in the town ... <p/> It starts with blue light up here ... <p/> Slowly the outlines of the hills turn into colourful pictures. <p/> The glaciers remain cold despite the first warm rays of the sun ... <p/> ... and the crevasses beneath the Dôme du Goûter are menacing. <p/> And when you look around, everything is still so beautiful that it couldn't be more beautiful. <p/> The valley is slowly waking up while it's coldest up here. <p/> You talk to the clouds and the nettles and ask them to let the sun go ... <p/> And the top is so close ... and far away at the same time. <p/> The last metres below the Vallot bivouac are pretty blown. The skis go on the ruzak, and instead of skis, I mount the crampons on my feet. The breath was getting deeper here, but there was no real strength in my legs. After a good five hours of walking we reach the bivouac. <Polona and Stojan are already at the bivouac when I get there. Looking down ... <p/> ... towards Mont Maudit ... <p/> ... and towards the one we came for. <p/> Ahead of us, there are already a few convoys going at a slow pace towards the summit. <p/> There is some hesitation about whether to go with or without skis towards the summit. In the end, we decide to go without. Meanwhile, Klemen continues past the bivouac with his team. <p/> We follow a little way behind him. After a few hundred metres, I realise that my lungs are straining almost to empty and my muscles simply don't have enough energy anymore. The pace is getting slower and slower, and at this rate we would have blown our timetable for the descent. There is no alternative but to turn around. I give Stojan and Polona a clear path to the top, but they decide to descend. <p/> Meanwhile, the wind picks up a bit up there. <p/> We continue to enjoy the views as we prepare for the descent. <p/> The summit will wait ... until next time. Meanwhile, one team is already skiing down the north side of the mountain. <p/> Another hello to the summit, and then the descent. <p/> For the first few pitches the snow is hard, blown, icy in places, and so are the muscles. I stop several times, trying to enjoy at least the views <p/> Below the bivouac, the skiing is better. The only distraction from carefree powder is the thought that we are near and on a glacier, and that there are glacial crevasses hiding under the snow. The fact that the previous day a mountaineer fell into a crevasse fifteen metres deep also gives us food for thought. He was lucky in the accident, as he was pulled to safety unharmed by helicopter rescuers. <p/> During our stops, we admire the snow and ice masses, so innocently white, yet menacing and dangerous. <p/> We ski towards the approach. The snow becomes a little crusty in places, a little heavier lower down, but still skiable. <p/> Soon we are above the Grand Mulets hut. <p/> We cross the Bossons over the Jonction, strung up. We are not the only ones. Somehow we are skiing at the same time with two Spaniards and a group of Austrians. <p/> The sun is already quite strong down here and it is not very pleasant to wait in line to cross the glacier. We are quickly across, then under the northern walls of the Aguilla di Midi we continue our way to the middle station of the gondola. <p/> The crossing is rather protracted, more so than the other way round, as we have some work to do. Finally, the greenery of the valley and the gondola come into view. <p/> We arrive in Chamonix in the afternoon, beautifully tired, hungry and thirsty. Maybe even a little disappointed. But, all the same, we have reached an altitude of 4362 m, skied down from there and arrived in the valley alive and well. For one of this year's final tours, that will be a big enough success <p/> P.S. Apparently, the summit is still where it was before we wanted to climb it ourselves. And I think it will be there for a while... waiting... maybe for us too <p/> One more thing about the costs: after the tour, we took a free afternoon in Chamonix, spent the night, and then headed home the next morning. <p/> For the trip from Tuesday to Saturday, for tolls, tunnel fees, fuel, accommodation and gondola tickets, we each spent just over 300.",Opinion/Argumentation

I didn't find it difficult at first because I was very much in love. That's why I have two children anyway. I didn't feel physical pleasure, but the emotional closeness was a good balance. But when the love died, I couldn't even kiss anymore. In the last few years, I can't even imagine touching anymore. Hugging a friend - that's still a thing. But the rest of it eludes me. I'm not happy that it's like this, but you get used to it (what else is there to do) and you get used to it. <p/> Sorry, maybe you didn't mean it that way, but that's what I think is wrong. Knowing that you don't want a long term partnership and sex, but still finding someone and lying to them until you get pregnant is just not OK. Pippa's case is ok because she only found out later and did not knowingly lie - and she and her ex-partner probably suffered a lot during the divorce. I understand where you are coming from, because it does not seem fair to me either that I will probably not be able to have a 'normal' family and children. But even heterosexual people often have problems finding a suitable partner. But you can use knowing yourself and your expectations to create the kind of relationship you really want. If you find an asexual partner or donor, you can also get pregnant without direct sexual contact. <p/> Yeah, the donor option is also an option and it's probably going to have to be a bit over the pond when the clock is ticking because I really want to be a mum one day and yeah, it would be really nasty to have a boyfriend just to get pregnant, so I'm really going to have to get into action in a couple of years and find an asexual partner to get emotionally involved with or a donor <p/> Yeah, it's really difficult and I guess if I find a man to live with I'd have to have the talk.But most of all I want to have a child in a few years time without having to have sex.I am fed up of telling my mum that I only see myself with a child without a man maybe that sounds selfish to have a child without a father so the real one gets a boyfriend go to bed when you get pregnant get rid of him.She doesn't even understand that I am repulsed by the thought of having sex <p/> It doesn't sound selfish to me. There have always been single women who have been without a man. If they can take good care of a child, then I don't think it's selfish.

"How is sex marketed? <p/> Adjectives that traditionally market sex well are spiritual, spiritual, esoteric and especially tantric <p/> In the early 1990s, massage parlours sprouted up all over our young homeland, where ""professionally trained"" masseuses kneaded the bodies of men, most of them bed-ridden and stressed, eager for invigorating exotic massages: Thai, Chinese and Malay, ordinary and specialised, hand and foot.

""The hired girls did, in fact, massage the clients to the best of their unprofessional abilities, and if a part of the client became unexpectedly stiff, they would simply do what was in the job description manually to relieve the client's tension. And that was it. Massage parlours did not, in principle, engage in conventional sexual intercourse, but that does not mean, of course, that what the lay public understands by the technical terms of blow jobs, hand jobs, spankings and whisperings did not take place there. In short, the owners of Slovenian massage parlours behaved in accordance with the political correctness of Western Christian civilisation, which tolerates many things, but not calling it fucking. Or it tolerates the presence of sex in its midst only if you put it in an artistic, installation, authorial, artisanal, institutional, aesthetic, cosmetic or spiritual context. Sex as such is not desirable. Hence the circus around pornography, prostitution and similar phenomena, which are not really about anything in terms of substance. <p/>The adjectives that traditionally market sex well, together with its side-effects, consequences and problems, are spiritual, spiritual, esoteric and, in particular, tantric. Tantric sex is a hit. It has infiltrated the terminology of the psychiatric profession, it has taken over the tabloid media, it has possessed dissatisfied housewives who dream of nirvanic continuity and dissatisfied gentlemen who muse at the thought of eight-, twelve- or twenty-four-hour erections, even though they have no idea what they could achieve with their stream limbs in that time. One thinks of His Holiness Guru Bhagwan Sri Rajneesh, whose revolutionary approach to tantric themes forced him to leave his spiritualised mother India in 1981 and settle in Oregon, USA, with a vast fleet of custom-built Rolls Royces. His Holiness set up a Tantric commune in the middle of Oregon, which traded heavily in enlightenment, and became famous for not granting quantity discounts to even the most wholesale buyers. When names from the music and film show business lined up, many paid obscene sums just to stand in line. And it was only a matter of time before the epicentre of practical Tantric philosophy would move to sunny California, where believer-friendly religions were springing up on a daily basis, and then, like all American fads, it would come pounding down on the old continent and, by extension, Slovenia.",Opinion/Argumentation

"In mid-August, we will experience one of the most famous meteor showers. Most of them will be seen on the night of 12-13 August 2017. We can expect 40 to 50 meteors per hour, which is less than usual as the Moon will interfere with the observations. <p/> Meteors from a single swarm seem to come from the same point in the sky. Source. <p/> Meteors are visible because tiny dust particles glow as they travel through the Earth's atmosphere at high speed. The average speed at which particles fly through the air is about 59 km/s. At that speed, it would take one second to travel from Ljubljana to Koper, and less than five seconds to travel across Slovenia. <p/> The fear of a meteor puncturing your roof is completely unnecessary, as these particles are so fragile that they burn up high in the atmosphere (over 90 km up).

The brightest bolide can leave trails that remain visible to the naked eye for several minutes in a dark sky. <p/> Comet Swift-Tuttle.

The comet was observed in China as early as 69 BC and scientists calculate that it will reappear in 2126.

"After Empire <p/> Why is America now generally perceived as a self-righteous, violent warmonger? How has a country that until recently played a vital role in shaping the international order suddenly become a symbol of global disorder? Why is America no longer the world's leading example of liberal democracy, international security and economic prosperity? Is the United States, the world's only surviving superpower, in danger of becoming marginal - of finding itself in a world that no longer needs it? <p/>After Empire, a critically acclaimed European bestseller, is a provocative and ultimately sobering look at America's changing role in the international community. Emmanuel Todd shot to fame when, in his first book, La Chute finale, he accurately predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union by analysing the country's fertility rates, infant mortality rates, marriage rates and literacy rates. Now - with the diagnosis that America's supremacy is weakening, which he made on the basis of demographic and economic factors - Todd offers an interesting re-evaluation of American superiority. <p/> Todd shows that at a time when the rest of the world is finding that it can get along without America - more and more countries are becoming educated, democratic and economically stable - America is slowly realising that it cannot get along without the rest of the world. Burdened by a huge domestic and foreign trade deficit, the falling value of the US dollar, the unexpected bankruptcy of several important companies and the fact that it can no longer support itself with its own production, America is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign money. This dependence is steadily eroding its political and economic influence, which is unprecedented in history. <p/> Readers' views <p/> In 2017, it is no longer possible to talk about a unipolar world order. What seemed unbelievable to the superficial observer in 2014 has become a reality. It is no longer possible to take decisions in the Eurasian area without the involvement of Russia or China. But let us go back a step further. The brief war in 2008, when Georgia sought to annex the separatist republic by force, was one of the first harbingers that the balance of power had changed. The Russian army was still clumsy at the time - compared to the annexation of Crimea - but it defeated the Georgian army, equipped and trained by the Americans, in a mere five days. <p/> In 2008, however great an optimist he was, he could not - however much he wished to - say much good about the Russian economy. Today, Russia has become the largest grain exporter, a self-sufficient food producer, and a force that is reviving and revitalising the automotive, aerospace, petrochemical and electronics industries. It has shown that it can no longer be blackmailed economically. <p/> The book 'After Empire' was published in 2006, but its basic idea must have been laid no later than 2005, when we were all still deeply asleep and unaware of the tectonic changes that were about to take place. One could say that the book was visionary, which makes it an extremely interesting read, because how is it possible that the author could have had a hunch in 2005 - when we were calling the Russian army 'old iron' and making fools of its economics - about the direction in which the world was moving? - Matej P. <p/> A look into the book",Opinion/Argumentation

"I suspect that there are at least a handful of us who remember all too well the days when Ray Cokes used to roll the Slayers unreservedly in prime time and when, in the admittedly slightly later hours of the night, MTV Europe used to play a lot of what we still throw into the drawer of alternative and not overly commercial brass bands and brass bands were listened to, not just watched. I wouldn't really debate the diversity of tastes here, but there was a lot to be heard on that channel in its day, especially if you were persisting in a late-night ambush or suffering from insomnia. It would be difficult to judge the current state of mind of all the various derivatives of this brass band institution; I have not been following it for some time, but judging by the words of my younger colleagues, the spirit of the eighties and early nineties has got a bit stuck and has gone on holiday somewhere unknown. <p/> Why such a butch introduction, anyway? Simply because Arrested Development is one of those bands that, without MTV and its inventions like Unplugged, would almost certainly not be known here. This predominantly black collective came to our country in the first half of the nineties on the waves of the aforementioned TV channel with their debut album, etched themselves in our little brains for eternity and then somehow disappeared from our consciousness, so the announcement of CUK in Šiška came as quite a surprise to me. I have to admit, I was almost convinced that AD had disbanded a long time ago, so I was quite happy to see them in Šiška, almost as happy as the fact that last year they released a quite decent and listenable album Strong, which, although it doesn't bring any particular surplus, is a quite pleasant read and the hiphop-funky-Motown inspired melodies easily crawl under your skin, which has been AD's virtue from the very beginning. All in all, a show that would be a sin to miss. <p/> If talking about the fact that the performers wowed the assembled crowd is usually as predictable as possible, I can say exactly that about Arrested Development's performance in Šiška. I haven't seen so many happy and satisfied people per square metre in a long time. Although Šiška wasn't bursting at the seams, it was exactly so full that one could comfortably move around, raise one's hands and sing a little here and there, although it was obvious that the majority of the crowd hadn't come any further than their debut album and, understandably, they were mostly tripping on those good old shtick that had gotten under our skin, or on the musical interludes of the legendary Bob Marley or the slightly less legendary 4 Non Blondes. AD are obviously well aware that their reach in Europe, where they have come after many years, was quite limited and that their brass band alone is just a bit too little to get people up on their feet, but on the other hand, it is a commendable act that the collective did not descend to the level of musical aspirations, although it was just not possible without the most famous shtick, especially in the finale. The intensity of the concert itself was at a high level from the very beginning and it got a bit higher towards the end, also thanks to the drum, bass and karaoke interludes, which, although they cheapened the overall impression a bit for my taste, then in a long encore, perhaps better said in the second part of the concert, they brought the show perfectly to the grand finale, when the brakes were released and the chemistry between the band and the audience worked so well that we can already speak of perfection. <p/> As they like to point out, AD play brass music for the people, by the people, and it would be really hard to find a better demonstration of this principle, especially if we're talking about big concerts, or concerts where at least a hundred or so heads are packed in and there's no question of an intimate atmosphere. There is no doubt that the ADs are well tuned and well tied and know exactly what and how to do to ensure that entertainment, mixed with a good-natured knock on the all-embracing human consciousness, achieves its aim and purpose. Truth be told, AD haven't come up with anything too revolutionary in the last fifteen years, but they make up for it perfectly with the sincerity they put into their music and, apparently, their performances, so it seems they are still that fresh band that exploded in our ears in the early nineties. There wasn't as much of a throwback in their performance as you might expect, more a kind of timelessness caught up in the here and now and a fascination with it, just as the band themselves seemed fascinated by the response they were getting. Look at the photographs and it might be clearer to you what I am trying to say. <p/> In short, the AD concert was simply an uninhibited, relaxed experience of an unpretentious brass band trying to please a wide audience, but not quite everybody and not exactly at any price, which is of course good for the audience, but a little less grateful for the performers themselves, who somehow remain in the shadow of the brass band, which in one way or another, not even necessarily a bad one, stands out and the whole. It's certainly fine and dandy to hear something new and unusual, but even simple entertainment, which nevertheless has a message and is not entirely shallow, is not superfluous and comes in handy now and then. AD are masters at this and it was a real pleasure to listen to them here for the first time, and I hope not for the last time.",Review

"The Secret World of Geisha <p/> A geisha is a Japanese artist who presents traditional Japanese arts. <p/> On our trip to Japan, we saw their dances and learned about some of the Japanese arts. <p/> The term geisha is made up of the words GEI (arts or arts) and SHA (person), comes from the Tokyo dialect and has been adopted from there into European languages. Geisha is called hangyoku (semi-precious stones) in Tokyo and maiko (dancing girl) in Kyoto during training. <p/> Geisha flourished most in the 18th and 19th centuries, when their services were in great demand. After Meiji came to power, their role in preserving traditional Japanese art changed. <p/> As early as at least the 7th century, Japan was known for female artists known as saburuke, or what might be called maids. They were girls and wives who were left alone, husbands and boyfriends lost in fights and battles. Somehow they had to survive, some selling sexual favours, while others, more educated, made a living entertaining guests at high society social gatherings. When the Emperor moved to present-day Kyoto in 794, the conditions were created for the start of Japanese geisha culture and soon afterwards these girls became synonymous with the beauty-obsessed elite. <p/> In traditional Japanese culture, men were not restricted from being faithful to their wives. The ideal wife, even of the upper classes, was a modest mother and head of the home. According to Confucius, love is of secondary importance. Men sought sexual pleasure and romantic liaisons not from their wives but from courtesans. From the 17th century, the shogunates had their pleasure quarters, outside of which prostitution was illegal. In these quarters, the yoyo ""actresses"" were ranked and licensed. The highest class of yujois, the forerunners of the geisha, were called tayuuje. They were both actresses and prostitutes, performing erotic dances and skits. <p/> In the 18th century, geisha appear. These pleasure quarters soon became glamorous entertainment centres offering more than just sex. The highly sophisticated courtesans of these districts entertained their clients by dancing, singing and playing music. Some became renowned poets and calligraphers. Gradually, they specialised in a new profession and pursued art and entertainment. The first geishas were men who entertained waiting customers to meet the most popular and talented courtesans. <p/> The rise of the geisha began at the end of the 18th century. Geishas worked in pleasure quarters, were actually imprisoned and were strictly forbidden to sell sexual favours to protect the business of courtesans. While licensed courtesans provided men with sex, geishas occupied a special niche as artists and learned female companions. <p/> At the turn of the 18th to the 19th century, geisha became a female profession and the notorious courtesans went out of fashion. Soon geisha developed their own style of dress and their trends were emulated by fashionable women from all walks of Japanese society. Geishas also began to rank, with some geishas still offering sexual favours, while others strictly entertained their guests with art. <p/> The geisha were dealt a severe blow with the end of the Second World War, when a general mobilisation was declared in Japan and everyone had to work in the fields and factories. Geishas also lost their reputation because some prostitutes pretended to be geishas when they met American soldiers. After the war, few returned to the geisha districts, rejecting the Western influence and returning to their traditional way of life and art, because the status of geisha was shaped by Japan's feudal past, and they maintain the traditional standards of their profession by this way of life if they want to remain geisha. <p/> There is no doubt that in the past, young geishas were also subjected to forced sexual relations and that their virginity was auctioned. After Japan lost World War II, the geishas were displaced and their reputation declined. With Japan's economic boom in the 1960s, the world and the status of geishas also changed. In modern Japan, young geisha are not forced to have sex and their sex life is a private matter. <p/> Is Japan a country where you would go on holiday?

"Anaemia is a dangerous companion to cancer <p/> General fatigue, weakness, poor concentration, depression, shortness of breath even with slight exertion, palpitations or a pounding sensation in the chest, retention of fluid in the body with the appearance of swelling, poor digestion and circulation all have a common denominator in cancer patients - anaemia. Anaemia, as anaemia may also be called, is not necessarily a consequence of cancer or its treatment, but can also be caused by a number of other, less serious, causes. However, it is often a poor blood count, with a reduced number of red blood cells (erythrocytes), which are responsible for ""transporting"" oxygen around the body to all cells, that can significantly worsen the life of cancer patients. <p/> The problems are particularly evident in blood and haematopoietic cancers, where anaemia ""comes with the territory"" of the disease. In some other cancers, however, anaemia occurs later, as a result of treatment of the cancer with chemotherapy and/or ionising radiation. One form of blood cancer is disseminated plasmacytoma, in which cancerous plasmacytoma cells grow in the red bone marrow of the flat bones, which is also the main site of production of healthy blood cells. ""The cancer cells invade the bone marrow and do not allow the healthy blood cells to develop,"" explains Dr Irena Preložnik Zupan, MD, PhD, a specialist in internal medicine at the Clinical Department of Haematology. <p/> ""When we want to define anaemia more precisely, we usually use the haemoglobin concentration in the blood. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), we speak of anaemia when the haemoglobin concentration in the blood is below 120 g/L for women and below 130 g/L for men,"" explains Preložnik Zupanova. Anaemia is divided into mild, moderate and severe forms. The former is defined as a haemoglobin concentration of between 100 and 120 g/L, the latter is between 80 and 100 g/L, and below 80 g/L is the severe form of anaemia, which usually causes the most problems, especially if it is rapid onset. <p/> ""In all cancer patients, we also check the basic blood count and anaemia is virtually impossible to miss. Often, however, the milder form of anaemia in cancer patients is somewhat neglected, but the patient's well-being and quality of life can be significantly impaired as a result. The patient is already experiencing fatigue, feeling unwell, unable to do everyday things, intimacy with a partner is impaired, unable to participate in family responsibilities, etc. All these symptoms can be present even in mild forms of anaemia,"" she warns. <p/> The causes of anaemia in cancer patients can be divided into three groups: <p/> (1) related to the cancer, where there is significant bone marrow involvement, <p/> (2) due to the treatment of the cancer with chemotherapy and/or radiation, as well as surgery, which can lead to blood loss, <p/> (3) and (4) a third group of causes can be associated diseases that the cancer patient has and, of course, also have an additional impact on the anaemia. <p/> ""If the heart is failing, we have poor blood circulation, if the lungs are diseased, there is insufficient oxygen supply, if the kidneys are not functioning well, toxic substances accumulate in the body and the organism is weakened,"" says Preložnik Zupanova. <p/> ""Cancer-related fatigue is a common phenomenon - a strange, constant feeling of general, severe tiredness, listlessness and helplessness, which cancer patients themselves attach much more importance to than doctors,"" explains Preložnik Zupanova, explaining the difference between the patient's and the doctor's perception of the problem. ""Also very important are the data showing the reduced success of cancer treatment in anaemic patients and the reduced survival of these patients compared to non-anaemic patients, irrespective of the type of cancer. "" <p/> And how common is anaemia in cancer patients? <p/> ""Based on the large 2001-2002 European Cancer Anemia Survey (ECAS) study of around 15,000 cancer patients, which looked at the incidence, prevalence and treatment of anaemia, anaemia was present in an average of 40% of patients at the time of enrolment, and in disseminated plasmacytoma, anaemia was present in two-thirds of patients at diagnosis. With cancer treatment, anaemia occurred in a further 30%"", says Preložnik Zupanova. <p/> Anaemia in cancer patients can be treated in several ways, depending on the cause. ""If a patient has severe problems due to anaemia, in terms of dyspnoea (breathing difficulties) or chest pain (a sign of ischaemic heart disease), we need to intervene with transfusions of concentrated red blood cells, which have an immediate effect. Usually these are patients with a severe degree of anaemia, haemoglobin concentration below 80 g/L. However, problems may occur earlier if the patient has associated heart or lung disease. Transfusion is also needed in patients who are actively bleeding due to cancer or if a previous attempt at erythropoietin treatment has been ineffective. In patients with mild and moderate anaemia, however, we prefer to treat with recombinant erythropoietins. The disadvantage is that it takes time for the haemoglobin concentration to rise, but it certainly avoids many of the disadvantages of transfusion,"" explains Zupanova. <p/> ""Studies are still ongoing to determine at which haemoglobin level it is best to start treating the patient, with what doses of erythropoietin and how often. In our hospital, we treat with erythropoietin when the haemoglobin concentration is below 110 g/L and administer it up to a target haemoglobin concentration of 130 g/L. At higher haemoglobin concentrations, side-effects such as thrombosis and arterial hypertension may occur. This in turn may put the patient at risk. ""Erythropoietins have a number of advantages over transfusions. The latter still pose a low risk of transmitting infections, cause iron to accumulate in the body and increase fluid volume. Immune reactions after transfusion can also be dangerous. The patient should receive a transfusion of concentrated erythrocytes in hospital for observation and appropriate management if problems arise. When treated with erythropoietins, these problems are avoided. The drug is usually in syringes for subcutaneous administration. Patients should be followed up regularly every four weeks to see how well the treatment is working. We are usually successful in patients who need the drug temporarily because of chemotherapy,"" explains Preložnik Zupanova. ""If we have a patient with advanced cancer, we mainly opt for transfusions of concentrated erythrocytes, as erythropoietins are ineffective in this case. """,Information/Explanation

"Why did we lose the island? Because politics has defeated the judicial branch of government <p/> Since this year, the island of Bled has also been a symbol of the church's insatiability. It is a symbol of the complot between the church and a part of politics. It is a symbol of the weak authority of the Slovenian courts. This year, the island was finally donated to the church. But the church, as the court also found, got it illegally! <p/> How? Initially, two Slovenian courts, the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court, ruled that the island and its commercial real estate belonged to the state, while the church on the island was given to the parish of Bled. But the RCC wanted it all, so the first government of Janez Janša came to its rescue, donating the island and its real estate to the church. The legal proceedings were restarted and came to a tragicomic conclusion. There were two proceedings in which the court should have annulled the gift contract. But the first one fell through because the first judge said that the state should have sued the Archdiocese of Ljubljana as well as the parish of Bled. And when the state sued both in the second, the second judge said that the state should sue only the parish. <p/> Since the ""superminister"" Žiga Turk did not appeal the decision, the real estate on the island became the property of the church and the island became the property of the church. But illegally. The court wrote that ""the evidence taken in the proceedings shows that there has been an impermissible traffic in real estate"" and that the church should not have been allowed to take ownership of the properties, which were exempted from traffic under the Cultural Heritage Protection Act. ""This prohibition is absolute, it is a coercive regulation"" <p/> The Bled Island case shows very clearly how weak and God-fearing the Slovenian courts are, and how strong the church and the politicians beholden to it are at the same time.",Opinion/Argumentation
"Description: Pollutants from road traffic are one of the main sources of PM10 concentrations in urban areas and have a negative impact on human health. In this thesis, we discuss the correlations between ambient air quality with PM10 and traffic data from automatic counting sites in Maribor. According to our findings, there are no correlations between these parameters, so we decided to set up a new monitoring site in the centre of Maribor. The new monitoring site will give us a more sophisticated measurement network in MOM, better information on air quality in the city centre and the possibility to better identify the relationship between traffic and PM10 concentrations.

"A BLUE PICTURE FROM 1968 <p/> DADS IN THE COURT <p/> The clock was already close to 00 when I was watching a film in the kitchen. Occasionally I heard a noise in the yard. It was in the form of some sort of shuffling, of harder objects in a crate or in a sack. It was getting more and more intense, it was pulling my firbec to lift my ass off the bench. At first I was eavesdropping by the balcony door in the dark. Then I tiptoed out onto the balcony and hid behind the longest parts of the yawn that was drying. <p/>The shifting stopped periodically as if eavesdropping on me. It was clear to me that someone was in the shuppa where it was as dark as a tunnel. The night was also dark. My vivid imagination had sketched the robber to perfection, poking at the punks. What should I do? I'm not going down there. <p/> I slowly open the balcony door again and explain to the hinges that they wouldn't dare to make any treacherous noises. And towards the living room, to my son who was at the computer, I call psssss psssss psssss psssss. I hinted as quietly as I could to my son that there was a thief in the yard. I couldn't hear myself very well, because I was talking so quietly, expecting my son to hear me. When I had talked him out of it, he came out onto the balcony. <p/> Now we were both eavesdropping on the robber. I confess that the trousers of my tracksuit were shivering. I can't imagine what a scream I would have let out if something had, um... <p/> You wait here, says my son. I was so hard with fear that I didn't know whether he was going to wake up Father Key. Or was I going to face the robber who was still robbing. I kept my eyes on the yard, so I wouldn't miss anything, so I would turn on the light at the right time, so I would shout at the right time,... I thought about what I would have to do. <p/> I see something white in the open. I was shocked at first. I couldn't believe it, but it was what I was seeing. It just popped into my head. What I saw were the underpants of my father. All the other bare skin merged with the darkness. Bravely, that's what, the barefoot went towards the shupi. My son and I looked at each other. I thought I would put my fist in my mouth if I had to, because at this time I couldn't afford to let out an animal scream. <p/> Finally, the brave ata shone his torch towards the point from where the thieving rattling was coming. Out comes a cat. <p/> A PALE PICTURE FROM 1968 <p/> Today I guess it must have been 68 when I assess Marjetka's age and what she remembered most. I compare her with my children when they were her age. I must remember to be more lenient with her, because I know that she and her mother lived on the margins of society and that affected everyone. They were brought so far by Mariette's father, who was dominated and ruled by alcohol until it drove him to his grave. It was not difficult to clear out the fridge and the wardrobes of clothes, slippers and shoes because there was still enough empty space. Mum did her best, but it was still small and tiny. My place is different today, better, but in the flood of everything in the shops, it gets lost in the lack of space. <p/> Marjetka already knew how to walk and didn't know where she and her mother were going until they entered through the entrance into a narrow hall, with tables covered with tablecloths and children, and Santa Claus sitting at the front. She might have heard of him, but this was the first time she had seen him. White-cell lanterns hung from the ceiling, filling the room with a yellow glow. I don't know how she managed to reach for the bag, which contained a pair of one-fingered gloves in sky-blue, with a white furry border at the wrist. She doesn't remember how she found her mother when it was over. But she remembers the warm gloves on her hands when they went home. <p/> Today she would like to know which good fairy gave her the gift of seeing Father Frost for the first time, she still wears those mittens in her heart, and her heart still sits on the little stool at the coffee table, timidly drinking tea from a cup. She would like to visit that aunt or uncle and thank them for their kindness in opening the joy in her heart, which, like a faded mural on the wall in December, breathes in the colours of memory. She worries if she or he would understand how much it would mean to her to see the kindness in her or his eyes and to be told that her mother would not be able to take her and she would be left without the memory of Santa Claus. <p/> EROTIC FANTASIES <p/> The windows were wide open, cooling the cramped room. The curtains with embroidered cranes allowed the presence of the moon to be felt in the room with open mouths. She stopped under the beam. A fluttering inside her body, like the underflutter of a butterfly's wings she had caught while riding a swaying bus. It awakened stocked desire and submerged waves, unexpectedly dug up and stirred. <p/>""Oh, those wooden seats,"" Olla groaned, looking towards the moon and letting her thoughts escape back to the experience of the ride. Pressing down on the hard seat, she felt a volcano awakening from the forest and a star tunnel opening. Each press brought a firmer embrace of warmth. The wood cooled her thighs, which were massaged by the rhythmic rocking, stopping, accelerating. Occasionally she squeezed her thighs, wanting more... Her eyes caught the fading landscape and suddenly she stood up as if the chair was too hot and walked to the door. She got off the bus, which had fewer passengers at each stop. <p/> A strange new feeling seeped into her from the strangers on the other side of the road and who surrounded her in front of the pedestrian crossing. The eye-contact as they passed each other frightened her, lest she betray them. <p/> ""What would I betray? ""to long for. ""But it's not written on my forehead,"" her thoughts argue and protest. <p/> She could hardly wait to step into the hall and cross the wooden stairs. She ran the last ten and rushed for the door as if someone was chasing her. She unlocked and locked it behind her. She hung the bag from her shoulder on the coat rack in the wardrobe. <p/> She went into the room and stood under the moonbeam. They would be alone this evening and night, as the folks back home were still enjoying their vacation when she had to get to work. She blinked and lifted her head to feel the caress. She covered her face with her right hand and stroked her hair from her forehead over the temples and down to the nape of her neck. She touched her cheek and face to the soft part of the raised hand, increasing the pressure of the touch. She stood with her chin resting on her chin. Her left hand, fingers spread, stroked across her stomach to her right hip and back. She was becoming more demanding, encircling now one ample breast and returning to the other. She lifted her head up and offered her neck to the moon beam to caress it. She turned her head to the right and left to receive more moonlight. The fingers of her right hand began to undo the tiny buttons on her white shirt. The blouse landed, on the floor by her bare feet, with her bra on top of it. Her left hand slipped out, the pads sliding slowly, over the hot soft skin of her breast. The nipples tensed, calling out to play the strings of the harp. The awakened strings tensed and waited for the others to play in the sounds of love and acceptance of the naked body. The long hair used up the nakedness of her back and caressed it as she moved her head gently left and right. The pads of her fingers threw away their inhibitions and caressed her body with the lightness of a delicate feather. They freed themselves from the rest of the laundry that had landed on the parquet floor. Pulled the linen sheet from the bed, wrapped and unwrapped herself as her hands danced around her naked body, exposing it to the moon and covering it. The warm skin called out for heat, for shit... She knelt at the foot of the bed and crawled like a cat to the middle. The two breasts danced, and with her right hand she took their weight away and squeezed them to her body. She moved towards the navel and the volcano, waiting impatiently for the eruptions. The star tunnel tingled pleasantly. She lowered her warm body onto the bed, cooling it just enough to make the anticipation grow. She let go of the weight of her body to feel its lightness. Turned onto her back, then onto her stomach, letting the pads wander and explore, letting the strings strain one after the other. The heart yearned, chased and gasped for air and acceptance. The heat was smouldering and ignited the eruption of a volcano. The body was engulfed by wild waves and enveloped in majesty.",Prose
"Real estates in Styria Renovated two-bedroom apartment in Zreče for sale <p/> REAL ESTATE FOR SALE <p/> This pleasant and recently renovated two-bedroom apartment in Zreče is a great opportunity for a family who wants to live in harmony with nature, but at the same time have all the infrastructure of a small town at their fingertips. Zreče is also a paradise if you appreciate the healing power of thermal water. <p/> Do you enjoy furnishing and decorating your home? Great. The apartment is sold unfurnished. <p/> Everything you will see in the photos below was... <p/> ... just an idea. <p/> I'm sure you have lots of ideas about how to decorate your new apartment. And I'm sure you'll have a few more as you look at the pictures. <p/> When the current owner bought the flat, it was not in the best condition. It was in need of a complete renovation. Two years ago, with creative ideas, a willingness to work and a lot of money, it was transformed from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan.... <p/> A view into the colourful and bright living room. <p/> The 17 square metre living kitchen is spacious and bright (you spend all day in it, by the way). It faces west and has access to the balcony, which is nice and useful at the same time -- you can ventilate the kitchen very quickly. <p/> Having your first coffee in the morning on the balcony, overlooking nature waking up, is an invigorating experience. <p/> From the kitchen, a door leads to the living room, where you can create another spacious bedroom. <p/> From the central corridor there is an entrance to the east-facing bedroom. <p/> You will certainly enjoy the separate toilet and bathroom. <p/> The apartment has had all the plumbing replaced, the walls patched and repointed, laminate flooring laid and brand new fittings fitted. The apartment has been given a new makeover, while retaining its functional layout. The owner would love to move it to the Ljubljana area, where she is moving to, but unfortunately this is not possible. <p/> The two-bedroom apartment is therefore waiting for a new owner who will breathe his own ideas and plans into it and furnish it as he wishes. <p/> If you want to be happy for life,... <p/> ... have a garden, says the Chinese proverb. If the old Eastern sages are right, then you can't go wrong with this apartment. From your balcony, you can admire a garden that can be used for growing garden flowers as well as home-grown vegetables. The gardens also have a tap for watering on hot summer days. <p/> In the basement, you also have a spacious (just over 7 square metres) cellar where you can store everything that won't go into the apartment. <p/> A great base for sports and recreation... <p/> Zreče, a small town in the Savinja Valley, is ideal for those who love nature but want to have all the city's infrastructure at their fingertips (and toes). Just a five-minute walk from your apartment, you'll find a shop, post office, pharmacy, kindergarten and the Zreče Primary School. If you turn on your heel in the opposite direction, you can quickly breathe the fresh air in the nearby forests or relax your mind while walking in the nearby hills. <p/> ... and a paradise for relaxation in the thermal pools of the Zreče thermal spas <p/> The first association with Zreče is tourism, as it is a thermal centre and nearby Rogla is a ski resort with a long tradition. <p/> The Zreče Spa offers a rich wellness programme, including saunas, a fitness centre, a gym and various health therapies. You're sure to enjoy an afternoon swim in one of the spa's eight swimming pools, or perhaps pamper yourself with a Thai massage. <p/> Rogla is the place to be for all those who love the snowy slopes - skiers, tobogganers and boarders, for whom a special slope has been prepared. With its sports stadium for fitness training, Rogla is also well known to local and foreign athletes. <p/> When ideas come to life... <p/> Every beginning is difficult, but when we look back on it after a while, we realise that those were actually the best times. What started out as dreams, ideas and plans evolve, take shape and finally become reality. <p/> Perhaps this apartment is a beautiful opportunity to live a new life. When you see it, you'll know.

"Price of a Canon i990 print <p/> Now we've finally got the red cartridge and we're taking the sustainability test. We printed our test photo endlessly with the best glossy paper settings, changing individual colour cartridges as they ran out. First we had to replace the light blue, then the light purple, then in turn the yellow, purple, black, light blue and finally the red. It turns out that the printer only uses 3.8% of the red dye when printing our photo (which contains quite a lot of red). <p/> A test document to measure the cost of printing a photo. <p/> It is also interesting to note that the printer is a little more economical with dye than its predecessor, the i965, or rather the colour layers it loads are thinner. Therefore, the price of a photo print with the i990 is 74 tolars, while the same photo print with the i965 costs 84 tolars. <p/> Comparison of the consumption of the individual ink cartridges used to print our test photo. <p/> When we tested the printer, we complained that the photos produced were too pink. We have now repeated the test with the latest firmware and drivers (everything was still in the testing phase in March) and found that the results are much better, although still a little too pink. <p/> Taking the above and summarising what we have already written about this printer, the i990 is the best and fastest photo printer on the market today.",Review

"Celebrities would almost be expected to be perfect in their well-groomed appearances on red carpets, at parties or in their everyday lives, surrounded by expensive wardrobes, jewellery and accessories, and their bodies extremely well-groomed. But it doesn't have to be, sometimes only a close analysis of a photo or a sharp eye can reveal their flaws - some of them hide them quite well, but there are many who obviously don't care. Feet certainly tell a lot about people's habits and personal hygiene, something that the following famous faces are probably not aware of: <p/> It's true that Naomi Campbell is one of the most successful models of all time, but that title has taken its toll - her feet look deformed. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Iman is absolutely beautiful, but the sandals are too small for any feet. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Even though Holly Madison is a former Playboy bunny and ex-girlfriend of Hugh Hefner, she could do a lot better with her feet. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Some people just don't have nature's way with every part of their body, so Jennifer Garner's slightly odd toes are not her fault. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Christina Hendricks didn't follow the rules this time - no matter how much you like your shoes, you shouldn't choose them if your foot is too big, or in this case, especially too wide for them. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Sarah Jessica Parker's effortless prancing around the streets of New York in heels as Carrie Bradshaw clearly had its drawbacks. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> As with Naomi, Kate Moss' feet have walked countless catwalks. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Kim Kardashian refused to give up her high heels even when she was heavily pregnant, and the result was a defeat. <p/> source: www.hollyscoop.com <p/> Britney Spears clearly hurt herself in this case, but she could have done with at least a hint of special, opaque make-up.",Opinion/Argumentation

""Slovenia has chosen this way of preserving the web, following the example of foreign countries, and there are now more than 40 of them.

"""The police, with their dedicated work in unenviable conditions, continue to prove that the almost impossible is still possible."" <p/> To commemorate the determined resistance of the militiamen and to protect our own country and our people, we police officers have chosen 27 June as our national day. Police Day is celebrated every year. This year's main ceremony, which commemorated the independence role of Slovenian militiamen, took place today, 27 June 2014, at the Police Academy. <p/> The ceremony was attended by the Police leadership, award recipients and distinguished guests, as well as by the families of fallen police officers who lost their lives in the war for the independence of Slovenia, and by police officers who were wounded at the time. <p/> Today, the Slovenian Police is celebrating more than twenty years of history. ""In all these years we have become a well-organised and efficient institution. But today, unfortunately, without modern equipment, without sufficient staff, in old vehicles and facilities, it is stagnant. /.../ Despite the fact that the police have been driven by the reserve for quite some time now, we have recorded good operational successes in the past period,"" said Stanislav Veniger, Director General of the Police, in his speech. <He added that ""we are living in a time when the demands of global security require us to move more decisively beyond the 'security in your own backyard' mentality. The world is getting smaller and smaller and borders are no longer impermeable. /.../ Fortunately, Slovenia is still considered a country with a high level of security. But security is not a given and it does not come for free. It takes a lot of hard work by dedicated, under-rewarded and stressed police officers. No one entered the police ranks with the idea of getting rich. But the motivation to work, derived solely from a sense of belonging and mission, is slowly losing its power. /.../ The police are certainly an important link in ensuring security, but they are not the only link. I am pleased to see that other authorities, also responsible for security, have begun to play their part more vigorously."" <p/> The Minister of the Interior, Dr Gregor Virant, also addressed the gathering. He said that today, twenty-three years after independence, we could say that Slovenians are more satisfied with our police than we are with our country in general. ""The police do not have the ups and downs of the state, but they are a bird in the sky. For many years it has enjoyed a high reputation among citizens, providing people with a sense of order, stability and security. Recently, more than before, it must be admitted, there is also a feeling that we are all really equal before the law. <p/> Today, the police are not afraid of anyone, but all those who have robbed the Slovenes and stolen Slovenia from them tremble before them. The police is a stable institution with tradition and quality leadership. As an expert on the state administration, I can say this. /.../ I have to say that one of the things that surprised me most positively was the extremely modern approach to governance and management. I have come to realise that there is, in fact, positive selection in the police in the choice of management staff. /.../ Modern methods of leadership and management, the introduction of good practices, the elimination of bureaucratic matters within the system, the establishment of smart performance indicators. These are all successes of which any organisation can be proud. Therefore, the leadership of the police force deserves a lot of respect and thanks for leading the police in the right direction. But leaders cannot achieve their goals without capable and dedicated colleagues, and the credit for the success of the police goes to every police officer who puts in the effort and achieves the expected results. So congratulations to all of you."" <p/> This year we are celebrating 10 years of cooperation in Europol, and the Ljubljana Mounted Police Station, which we recently celebrated, is celebrating its anniversary. For the 66th year, the Police Orchestra has been delighting us with its delicate sound. Under the baton of Tomaž Kmetič, it once again enriched our ceremony. <p/> At ceremonies held throughout the country these days, meritorious police employees are awarded in their respective police units for their contribution to the promotion of safety culture and for their merits and contribution to the development and strengthening of safety, and individuals from other countries and other organisations are presented with police badges of cooperation. The highest police awards were presented at today's ceremony by the Minister of the Interior, Dr Gregor Virant, and the Director General of the Police, Stanislav Veniger. <p/> The Golden Police Cooperation Badge was awarded to Josef Erhard of the German Police for excellent cooperation in the field of car crime over many years and to the Slovenian Armed Forces for excellent cooperation over many years, which undoubtedly makes an important contribution to the readiness to carry out the operational tasks of the police. The award was received by the Chief of the General Staff of the Slovenian Armed Forces, Major General Dobran Božič. <p/> The Golden Police Shield was awarded to Martin Poharc from the Celje Police Directorate, Dean Jurič from the Koper Police Directorate and Vojko Rupnik from the Kranj Police Directorate. <p/> The Grand Shield of the Police with a Bronze Star was awarded to Marjan Anzeljc from the Police Specialities Administration, Simon Velički, Director of the Kranj Police Directorate and Mag. Stanislav Vrečar, Director of the Ljubljana Police Directorate. <p/> The Grand Shield of the Police with the Silver Star was awarded to Andrej Rupnik from the Office of the Director General of the Police. <p/> The Great Shield of the Police with a gold star was awarded to the Special Police Unit of the General Police Directorate, on whose behalf the award was accepted by its Commander Rado Abutovič, <p/> while the highest award of the Police, a firearm, was awarded to Franc Sablič, Director of the National Forensic Laboratory. <p/> We would like to congratulate all the award winners for their outstanding contribution to the safety of citizens and the reputation of the Slovenian Police. <p/> Today was also the Police Open Day, where we prepared an attractive presentation of the Slovenian Police for all participants and visitors. There was great enthusiasm for the passing parade of mounted police officers and their noble assistants, as well as for the demonstration of helicopter rescue, such as that carried out on many occasions by the crews of the Air Police Unit, who took part in the rescue of people in the recent floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a police helicopter. <p/> Later, it was possible to see up close what a police helicopter looks like, as well as how a crime scene investigation van is equipped, and what the so-called ""blinda"", which is used to transport protected persons, looks like. We also displayed a mobile police station and a Schengen bus, as well as a speed enforcement vehicle on the motorway, the so-called provido. <p/> The children were particularly interested in the equipment of the police officers of the Special Police Unit. They were fascinated by their helmets, shields and attractive stories from the protection of various public events. <p/> The younger visitors, in particular, were most excited to see the motorcycle police officers and to take photos on their white and blue motorcycles, as well as the police service dog handlers with their trained four-legged friends, and the mascot of Constable Leon.",News
"The Bologna Renewal <p/> The central objective of the Bologna Declaration (BD) is the creation of an open Common Higher Education Area (CEEA), allowing European students and higher education staff to move freely within it, to have comparable skills and competences, and to be employable. <p/> The Bologna Process takes its name from the Bologna Declaration, signed in Bologna (Italy) in 1999 by ministers responsible for higher education from 29 European countries, including Slovenia. The document set the guidelines for the development of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The Bologna Process (BP) is to be implemented in the signatory countries (and other countries later associated) by 2010. <p/> The objective is to be achieved through various measures such as the establishment of comparable and transparent higher education structures and levels, mutual recognition of relevant and comparable higher education qualifications, the establishment of mutually recognised credit and quality assurance systems, the promotion of student and teacher mobility, the development of the European dimension in education and the increased competitiveness of European higher education in the world. <p/> The BP Guidelines also link to one of the Lisbon Strategy's objectives, which foresees that by 2010 Europe will be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. <p/> The path to the BE is also represented by previous documents, reflecting in particular the aspirations for university autonomy, comparable qualifications and their recognition within the ERA, and their standardisation. <p/> Despite the scope opened up by the BD, it is not a comprehensive document specifying implementation and serving as a ""how-to guide"", but leaves a large degree of autonomy to HEIs and partners. Nevertheless, the CBD highlights some key points: <p/> the central role of universities in the development of the European cultural dimensions <p/> the independence and autonomy of universities <p/> the ERA as the main route to mobility and employability of EU citizens and the overall development of the continent <p/> the adaptation of higher education systems to constant social change and the evolution of scientific knowledge <p/> the international competitiveness of European higher education. <p/> The main objectives of the BD Declaration are: <p/> the adoption of a system of easily identifiable and comparable degrees, including the ""Diploma Supplement"" form - in order to foster the recruitment of European citizens and the international competitiveness of the European higher education system <p/> the adoption of a system with two main levels of study, the Bachelor (minimum 3 years) and the Postgraduate (Master, PhD) degrees awarded after the first level, is also relevant for the European labour market as an appropriate level of qualification <p/> establishing the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) as an appropriate means of facilitating greater student mobility Credits could also be obtained through lifelong learning <p/> promoting mobility <p/> promoting European cooperation in quality assurance, by developing comparable criteria and methodologies <p/> fostering the necessary European dimension in higher education, in particular in relation to curriculum development, inter-institutional cooperation, mobility schemes and integrated study, training and research programmes. <p/> Ministers of the signatory countries meet every 2 years to assess the state of implementation of the BP in the individual Member States and in the ERA as a whole. Each ministerial meeting is followed by a communiqué with proposals for further development. The number of associated countries has increased significantly since 1999, to 45. <p/> What does the reform of higher education bring you? <p/> At the end of May this year, the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia adopted an amendment to the Law on Higher Education, and in mid-June the Law on Recognition and Valuation of Education was adopted. These two laws constitute the basis for the implementation of the higher education reform, which is based on the guidelines of the Bologna Process, or the process of creating a single European Higher Education Area. The reform will be introduced gradually by higher education institutions (faculties, academies, etc.), and the following innovations will be the most visible for students: <p/> 1. New structure of studies <p/> a) Studies will now be shorter and divided into three diploma levels: <p/> * 1. Bachelor's degree, which lasts three or four years and is run as a higher professional degree or university degree * Bachelor's degree, or Master's degree, which lasts one or two years (so that together with the first bachelor's degree in the same field of expertise, it lasts five years) * Bachelor's degree, or Doctoral degree, which lasts three years. <p/> Exceptions are study programmes for professions regulated by European Union directives, which may be structured differently. <p/> b) Conditions for admission to the higher degree <p/> To be admitted to the second cycle, you must have completed a first cycle degree in a relevant professional field. If it is not in the same field of study (e.g. if a student wishes to continue his/her studies in economics at a second level after completing a first degree in mechanical engineering), a maximum of 60 credits of additional study may be prescribed for this transition. These can be taken as part of the electives in the first bachelor's degree, or through examinations and courses prior to enrolment in the second bachelor's degree. <p/> Admission to the third cycle is open to anyone who has completed the second cycle, who has completed programmes in professions governed by EU directives which are worth 300 credits or more, or who has completed a four-year programme at level 1 and who has demonstrated specific achievements which can be assessed at 60 credits. <p/> As a general rule, 60 credits will be awarded for admission to the new two-year programmes at the second cycle to those who have completed the old bachelor's degree programmes in the same or related fields of study. <p/> The completion of a specialisation may be used for admission to the third cycle only if there has been a notable success in research or professional work, which may be assessed at 60 credits, or if additional study requirements of 60 credits have been set. <p/> Those who have completed a master's degree under the old system shall be awarded 60 credits of study requirements on entry to the third cycle (doctoral studies). <p/> c) Deadline for the introduction of the new structure and transition period <p/> The first academic year in which enrolment in the new degree programmes should be possible will be 2005/2006, and the last academic year for the introduction of the new study structure will be 2009/2010. <p/> Students enrolled in higher education before the introduction of the new study programmes will continue and complete their studies under the conditions in force at the time of their enrolment, up to the end of the academic year 2015/2016. If a student repeats a year and the programme in which he/she enrolled is no longer available, he/she shall continue and complete his/her studies under the new study programmes. <p/> 2. Diploma Supplement <p/> All students will receive a Diploma Supplement free of charge together with their diploma, which will be issued in Slovene and one of the official languages of the European Union. The Diploma Supplement is an integral part of the diploma which includes information about the higher education system and the student's performance (grades), as well as a unified description of the nature, level, content and status of the study programme. Students will benefit from the introduction of the Diploma Supplement, as all the skills and knowledge they have acquired during their studies will now be recorded in the Diploma Supplement, which will also make it easier for them to find a good job and to enrol for further studies. <Study requirements in the study programmes will now be evaluated in terms of credit points (ECTS), which means that each student's workload in the official programme will be credited (the work a student puts in to complete the requirements, including seminars, tutorials, independent study, lectures, the preparation of a thesis, etc.). Each year of the study programme will comprise 60 credits. The first cycle will be 180 or 240 credits (three or four years), the second cycle will be 60 or 120 credits (one to two years, but in such a way that, in the same field of expertise, together with the first cycle, the programme lasts for five years), and the third cycle will be 180 credits (three years). <Joint study programmes <p/> Higher education institutions will be allowed to establish and run joint study programmes with other Slovenian and foreign higher education institutions. This means that students will study at different higher education institutions within one study programme and will obtain one joint degree at the end of their studies. <p/> ... will now be cheaper, shorter and simpler and will replace the nostrification system used until now. <p/> 6. Tuition fees and access to studies <p/> No tuition fees can be charged for full-time studies at public higher education institutions at the first degree level. Free studies at the second cycle will be provided to at least 30 % of students, with social status, regional representation and the scarcity of professions being taken into account as criteria for determining the proportion of students to be included in this ratio, in the ratio 70:20:10. <Co-governance and student participation will be increased <p/> Student membership of higher education bodies has been increased from one in seven to one in five, and students now have one in five votes in the election of university rectors. Student surveys will also be given greater importance in the area of student co-governance. Students will also be represented in the Public Agency for Higher Education, which will carry out external evaluations of higher education. <p/> 8. Foreign students: <p/> can receive scholarships in Slovenia, but only if the principle of reciprocity is applied <p/> lectures will be able to be organised in a foreign language, even if the lecture is not also organised in Slovene.",Information/Explanation
"President Pahor at investment conference in Istanbul: ""Slovenia is important for Turkey and Turkey is important for Slovenia"" <p/> Today, at the end of his official visit to the Republic of Turkey, the President of the Republic of Slovenia, Borut Pahor, attended an investment conference aimed at further promoting the Slovenian economy and presenting current investment opportunities in Slovenia. In addition to the President of the Republic of Slovenia, Mr Borut Pahor, important Turkish investors were also addressed by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec, State Secretary of the Ministry of Finance Mitja Mavko, a representative of the Slovenian Compensation Insurance Company and the Director of Spirit Boštjan Skalar. In his opening remarks, the President of the Republic stressed that Turkey and Slovenia have a long-standing friendship and respect, which is also very important for economic cooperation on both sides. He described Turkey's goal of becoming one of the ten strongest economies in the world in the next 10 years as inspiring and admirable. ""Turkey is of strategic importance for Slovenia and we need to strengthen cooperation at all levels. Slovenia is important for Turkey and Turkey is important for Slovenia,"" the President said. Addressing more than 80 Turkish investors, President Pahor presented Slovenia as a dynamic, open and export-oriented country and invited potential investors to come to Slovenia. He highlighted Slovenia's human potential and its exceptional geopolitical position as a meeting point between Central and South-Eastern Europe. In this context, he recalled that he and President Gül had agreed at their meeting yesterday on the utmost importance of the Brdo Process initiative for the stability of the Western Balkans. There are many opportunities for strategic investment in Slovenia, President Pahor said, underlining that Slovenia is very interesting for Turkey, as the two countries have well-regulated contractual relations and have concluded all the most important agreements in practically all areas of common interest. Among the most important of these is the Strategic Partnership Agreement. Yesterday afternoon, the President attended the 6th Annual Conference of Ambassadors of the Republic of Turkey, where he gave a short lecture. After the lecture, the President also met with the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Mr Ali Babacan. Late yesterday afternoon, President Pahor met with the Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. During their talks, President Pahor and Mr Erdoğan noted that the effects of the strategic partnership signed two years ago are already visible and committed to further cooperation. Prime Minister Erdoğan welcomed President Pahor's willingness to open an investment conference in Istanbul today to present concrete opportunities for Turkish investors to invest in Slovenian companies, for more vibrant cooperation between the economies of the two countries, and for a possible joint appearance on third markets. The two also discussed some aspects of the Syrian crisis, which has led to over 600,000 refugees fleeing to Turkey in recent months. In this context, Mr Erdoğan outlined his views on stopping the armed conflict in the light of the forthcoming Geneva 2 meeting, as without immediate action the conflict could take on wider regional dimensions. <p/> Search <p/> Contact",News

"16 March 2010 - We have just five years to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is therefore calling for world leaders to adopt a global action plan at the UN Summit in New York this September to accelerate the achievement of these goals. <p/> ""We must not disappoint the millions of people who look to the international community to deliver on its promises in the Millennium Declaration. Let us come together in September to deliver on those promises,"" Ban said in his Keeping the Promise report, released today. <p/> For the Millennium Development Goals Summit on 20-22 September, the report will serve as the basis for intergovernmental agreements on the Summit's outcome document. The report identifies success factors, good practices, highlights gaps, highlights future challenges and makes proposals for action to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs over the last five years. Further complementary reports are expected, including an annex to the Secretary-General's report in April with basic statistics on the implementation of the MDGs. A more detailed report with statistics on the implementation of the Goals will follow in June, followed by an overall assessment of the shortcomings of international cooperation in early September. <p/> ""We have the knowledge and the resources to achieve the Millennium Goals,"" Ban stressed in his report, referring to the goals of the Millennium Declaration of 2000, which aim to end poverty, hunger, disease and significantly reduce maternal and child mortality by 2015. <p/> The report notes that some countries have made great strides in overcoming extreme poverty and hunger, increasing school enrolment and child health, expanding access to safe drinking water, strengthening control of malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases, and expanding access to HIV treatment (for more information, see Millennium Development Goals: A stocktaking exercise). <p/>These successes are being seen in some of the poorest countries, proving that the MDGs are indeed achievable if we have the right policies, the right level of investment and international support. <p/> Progress has not been the same everywhere, however, and the report predicts that many countries will not reach the goals. The greatest challenges are faced by the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, some small island developing states that are most vulnerable to natural disasters, and countries facing internal unrest. <p/> The report points out that the MDGs are not being missed because the targets are unachievable or there is too little time, but rather because of unfulfilled promises, inadequate funding and a lack of accountability. The result is a failure to provide financial incentives, services, technical support and appropriate partnerships. As a result, progress in poverty eradication has been unacceptably slow, and some of the hard-won successes are being eroded by the food and financial crises. <p/> Good practices <p/> Global action to achieve the MDGs has been underway for almost ten years and a number of good practices have emerged. The most important of these are development plans at national level. Successful countries are pursuing a pragmatic policy mix, focusing on their own development capacities. International development cooperation needs to support more intensively such national development strategies and actions to strengthen their own development capacities. <p/> Of course we need economic growth, but it is not the only condition for progress. Growth must be inclusive and equitable if we are to achieve optimal poverty reduction and real progress towards the MDGs. <p/> Hard-won progress can be undone by economic and other shocks. Countries need forward-looking macroeconomic policies that can promote balanced growth across the board. For example, the Millennium Goals can be achieved through sustained public investment and development strategies designed accordingly, and universal social protection. <p/> The report stresses that financing for the MDGs must start 'at home'. Developing countries must raise and allocate their revenues accordingly, and donor countries must deliver on their promises to increase ODA. Although development aid reached its peak in 2008, countries are still largely failing to deliver on their development aid promises. <p/> Countries pledged around USD 154 billion in ODA at the G8 Gleneagles Summit in 2005 and have not kept their promises. They have under-pledged by $35 billion a year and under-pledged by $20 billion for Africa. ""If promises are not kept, the poor suffer and die in even greater numbers,"" the report points out. <p/> The report outlines a number of promising government proposals to ensure adequate funding for the MDGs, including a new financing mechanism for better health systems and a new global approach to food security, which was elaborated at the 2009 G8 meeting in L'Aquila. These proposals need to be implemented as soon as possible if we are to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs and lay a solid foundation for the G8 and G20 meetings in Canada in June 2010. <p/> At the same time, innovative financing schemes must continue to be developed and the MDG Summit in September this year must establish a transparent mechanism to promote the delivery of global development aid pledges. Such a mechanism must have its own action plan with timetables, forms of monitoring and enforcement. <p/> UN Secretary-General Ban calls for a new 'compact' that is not just government-led, but inclusive of all stakeholders, developed and developing countries, civil society organisations, private business, philanthropy and multilateral systems. Each of these stakeholders must strive to make the most efficient use of its own resources. They must act effectively and collectively. This September, the Summit will officially take place as a high-level plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly. It will provide a unique opportunity to strengthen collective action and partnerships to achieve the Millennium Goals by 2015. <p/> ""In September, we will come together to build on the achievements of the past years and to address the existing gaps. We have a shared responsibility to shape a better future for generations to come,"" the Secretary-General stressed. ""Achieving the MDGs is only possible by delivering on our promises, with the right policies, financial incentives and sustained action.""",News

"Press release - Taxi Drivers' Union at the 29th meeting on 04.05.2021 <p/> Adoption of the amendment to the law in favour of Ubr at the 29th meeting of the Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Spatial Planning <p/> On 4.5.2021, taxi drivers once again drove down Šubičeva Street to show their support for Dejan Jefim, the President of the Taxi Drivers' Union, who spoke in favour of the taxi drivers' position at the 29th meeting of the Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Spatial Planning, on the occasion of the draft law on amendments and additions to the Law on Road Transport (ZPCP-2I).On 5.5.2021, taxi drivers drove down Šubičeva Street to show their support for Dejan Jefim, the President of the Taxi Drivers' Union, at the 29th meeting of the Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Spatial Planning. <p/> During the meeting, Jefim highlighted the weaknesses of the amendment of the law due to the arrival of Uber, but unfortunately his opinion was not heard by the majority. We would also like to thank Sasha Kumer, Secretary General of the SDPZ, who also supported the taxi drivers' union at the meeting and gave the SDPZ's position. We would also like to thank the SAB, the Left Party, the LMŠ and the SD for their support. <p/> Despite the efforts of the union to raise the issue of changing the law in favour of Uber, unfortunately most of the cons did not want to hear it, they are all just making excuses, saying memorised sentences and avoiding real answers. <p/> With the efforts of taxi drivers and the help of the state, the quality of taxi services has improved dramatically over the last 10 years. Taxi meters have been made compulsory (annually certified and calibrated), a licence is required, a tourist examination, no criminal record, adequate financial standing - fixed assets, a roadworthiness test twice a year, special insurance for passengers, the introduction of cash registers, etc. <p/> With the current law, the State strongly regulates the taxi business and makes fraud impossible. However, by changing the law, the taxi business will be set back 30 years, so years of effort will be wiped out in a matter of months. Why? Simply because Uber has a different business model and cannot operate under our laws. <p/> The current government is silent on the fact that Uber will not pay a cent in tax on their profits. The current government is silent on the known facts of the problem of Uber drivers appearing abroad. The current government is silent on the fact that wherever Uber is present, there are major problems, read - robberies, rapes, beatings and even murders. The current government is silent on how it will protect consumers and the potential disputes and problems that will arise with the arrival of Uber, how and in what way the government will protect consumers and who consumers can turn to in order to resolve them. The current government is silent on the fact that a ride that today a consumer pays €5 for on the taximeter when Uber arrives will, according to their algorithms, also be €20 or more if demand is high at that moment. The current government is silent that the change in legislation does not do any good, not for the country, not for the taxi drivers, and least of all for the consumers. <p/> Despite the fact that we did not win the session and the change in the law was approved in the session, we will not stop, we will work for all taxi drivers and residents and their better future. We are concerned about the future and the safety of our citizens, that is why we are NOT against ""competition"", but we are against changing the law. <p/> Unlike the current government, we in the union are happy to see the cooperation and listening of local authorities. We are happy about the warm and positive reception at the MOL, we are happy that in the future in Ljubljana, in cooperation with the Mayor Mr Jankovič, we will bring the taxi business to the highest possible level, both with vehicles, drivers and prices that will be accessible to any user, regardless of the arrival of foreign platforms.",Opinion/Argumentation

Thus, by his primary claim, he claimed payment of SIT 1 655 603, and by his subordinate claim he claimed payment of SIT 700 000 under the first contract and EUR 5 356 under the second contract, in which the sum insured was denominated in DEM. The Court of First Instance ruled that the defendant must pay the plaintiff SIT 170 000, dismissed the primary claim in excess and further ruled on the costs of the proceedings. The Court of Second Instance allowed the applicant's appeal only in part by modifying the costs order, but otherwise dismissed it and upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance. <p/> The review was delivered to the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia and served on the defendant, who did not reply. <p/> The review is not allowed. <p/> According to Article 367(2) of the Civil Procedure Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 73/2007 ZPP - UPB3), a review is admissible in property disputes if the value of the contested part of the second instance judgment exceeds the amount of EUR 4,172.926 (formerly SIT 1,000,000). The applicant has indicated an amount of SIT 1,485,603 (now EUR 6,199.31) as the review value of the dispute, but such a definition is not correct for the purpose of determining the review value of the dispute. It is the sum of two amounts which he was unsuccessful in the litigation: the rejected amount of SIT 530 000 (now EUR 2 211,65) in respect of the first insurance contract which he himself had concluded and the total rejected amount of SIT 955 603 (now EUR 3 987,66) in respect of the collective accident insurance. The sum cannot be taken into account because each insurance contract is independent, concluded at different times and with different content, and therefore the contracts also constitute different factual and legal bases for the dispute. Since the condition laid down in Article 41(1) of the CCP in conjunction with Article 39 of the CCP for aggregating the amounts in dispute is not met, the value of each individual claim must be taken into account under the second paragraph of the same Article. <p/> None of the amounts mentioned exceeds the audit threshold. Therefore, pursuant to Article 377 of the CPC, the Court of Appeal decided on the applicant's unauthorised revision as set out in the operative part of the present decision, which also includes a decision on the applicant's claimed revision costs.",Legal/Regulation

"Others about the event <p/> 7th Children's Bazaar Ljubljana: 2012 <p/> This is the second year in a row that Afrodita Cosmetics has participated in the Children's Bazaar. We recognised a great opportunity in the project to present our new BABY & KIDS NATURAL cosmetics to both existing and potential new customers. Considering the number of contacts established and the positive reactions from visitors, we believe that our participation in the Children's Bazaar has been extremely successful both years. We have fulfilled our main objective - to get closer to our target group of customers: mainly parents, but also toddlers. For the latter reason, we plan to participate in the Children's Bazaar again next year. <p/> Nastija Egartner Marketing Communication Kozmetika Afrodita d. o. o. <p/> The Children's Bazaar in Maribor and Ljubljana presented many opportunities for families to spend quality time together. That is why Sava Hotels & Resorts was not missing among the suppliers. While children were eagerly participating in children's workshops at our stand, their parents and older companions were interested in active holidays in our destinations. We are delighted to have recorded a large number of bookings for family holidays as a result of our presentation at the Otorka Bazaar, and we recommend this type of cooperation to other organisations and companies. <p/> Slavica Rešeta Market Administrator - Slovenia Sava Hotels & Resorts <p/> At the 7th Children's Bazaar Ljubljana, we had a very pleasant experience with the organiser of the fair, Proevent d.o.o., with our fair performance, where we presented the project ""I like to eat fish"". The staff of this company is characterised by their exceptional professionalism, professional and responsible attitude and their great sense of care for exhibitors and visitors. We look forward to working with them in the future. <p/> This is the first year we have participated in the Children's Bazaar in Ljubljana. Our company is still young, but we aim to be the best provider of developmental or didactic toys for children of all ages. The Children's Bazaar is the best way for us to get in touch with our customers and direct users of our toys. We were very satisfied with the attendance and the atmosphere on the fairground and we will definitely see you in 2013. <p/> Peter Goričan Singa d.o.o. <p/> 7th Children's Bazaar Ljubljana in the media <p/> As we are a very young company, this year was our first time participating in the Children's Bazaar. We were delighted with the atmosphere at the event, as there was really no shortage of positive energy. We achieved our business goals: we presented our organic cotton products for babies and toddlers to young parents and pregnant women. We had a unique response to our stand and got confirmation that we are heading in the right direction. This customer contact is very important for our online shop, so we will definitely be back next year. <p/> Alenka Bombažek d.o.o. <p/> Before the Children's Bazaar event there was a lot of apprehension about how critical visitors would react to our promotion of craft professions. Up to now, we have mainly targeted primary school pupils in the last third of the school year when promoting craft professions, but we were pleasantly surprised by the decision to focus on younger pupils this time. The response from the children, and especially from their parents, has been overwhelming. The Slovenian Chamber of Commerce and Industry would also like to highlight the exemplary cooperation with the organiser Proevent d.o.o. and would like to take this opportunity to thank them very much. <p/> Mitja Korunovski Education Centre of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry <p/> We participated in the Children's Bazaar for the second year in a row. Last year, when we participated for the first time, we were surprised and delighted by the visit, but at the same time, we were not adequately prepared to communicate with the visitors. This year we prepared better and offered visitors an animation - Frisbee golf, which is one of the activities in our Summer Park on Krvavec, new this season. Attendance at this year's fair was once again very good and certainly above average compared to other fairs we attend. We are also pleased with the response of visitors to the fair, as a number of them have already visited our park and redeemed benefits/prizes from our animation game from the fair. A big thank you to the organisers for listening and coordinating. <p/> Luka Vrančič RTC Krvavec, d.d.<p/> Today, we visited the Children's Bazaar at the Economic Exhibition Centre with the children from the Najdihojca kindergarten in Ljubljana (Butterflies and Magpies groups). We had a free guided tour of the fair. The tour guide was very nice and we must praise her for making a great effort. The Bazaar itself is interesting and offers a variety of activities for both young and old. Thank you on behalf of the children and staff of the Najdihojca Kindergarten, Thumbelina Unit - Butterflies and Magpies Group. We will come again. <p/> Najdihojca Kindergarten, Thumbelina Unit <p/> The future is in the hands of our children, let's make sure it is full of life, peace, happiness, beauty, joy of work and learning... We brought a piece of this idea to life at this year's Children's Bazaar. With our Montessori room and the Montessori materials and other developmentally-didactic toys presented, we wanted to add a touch of the importance of education. Visitors approached with great interest, with many questions, eager for information. The Montessori room was full of our little ones throughout the fair and surrounded by many observers, to whom we gave away great prizes. We are definitely still in touch with our visitors. <p/> Katarina Zver Belovič World of Children <p/> The large turnout at this year's Children's Bazaar event for families is a real confirmation that the organisers know how to listen to both children and parents. The pleasant and unobtrusive sales approach of the exhibitors, the educational activities and the charity campaigns provide a pleasant atmosphere for visitors and for us - the companies presenting our products or services. <p/> Tanja Pirc Podobnik Mercator d.d. <p/> Ljubljanske mlekarne has already presented itself at the Children's Bazaar several times. We have been developing the idea for the presentation ourselves over the years, but GR Engineering's support has always been welcome in its realisation. The team, which is competent in various areas (technical, communication, organisational, etc.), has always been there to help us achieve our goals. The Children's Bazaar is well organised and we will definitely be back again this year. <p/> Sara Wagner Ljubljanske mlekarne d.d. <p/> At the Children's Bazaar, which took place at the Gospodarské razstaviště Exhibition Centre, children from the Oton Župančič Kindergarten were given the opportunity to visit various exhibitions, and at the same time, they participated with their own items and also performed on stage. The professionals decided to take the children to the Children's Bazaar in the future, which offered a variety of activities for children. <p/> Ksenija Grabovica Assistant Director of the Otona Župančič Kindergarten <p/> The Children's Bazaar made a very positive impression on us, especially the freshness of the young families and their interest in experiencing nature and our ethnological workshops. <p/> Nives Brezovnik Rogatec Institute for Culture, Tourism and Development <p/> In 2010 we participated in the Children's Bazaar for the first time. The organisation of the event (exhibition spaces and assistance with their equipment, communication with the organisers, etc.) is at a very high level. The wide range of exhibitors and the free entry for visitors ensure that the attendance is really high. This gives exhibitors more than enough opportunities to showcase their products and activities.",Opinion/Argumentation
"Zdenko Matoz, kultura Fri, 27.05, 22:29 The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain is usually received with reluctance at first, but by the end of the concert the audience is enthusiastic. The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain was formed 25 years ago and is mainly made up of BBC announcers Dave Suich, Peter Brooke Turner, Hester Goodman, Richie Williams, Kitty Lux, Will Grove-Whit, Jonty Bankes and George Hinchliffe. <p/> Known for their eclecticism, the band love to play punk classics such as the Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK, grunge classics such as Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, pop classics such as Kate Bush's Wuthering Heights and classics such as Wagner's Hedgehog Valkyrie, and will be performing at Ljubljana's Križanke tomorrow, 29 May, at 8.30pm. We spoke to founding member and leader George Hinchliffe about this unusual orchestra and its musical approach. How do people react when they first hear your ukulele orchestra? <p/> Usually audiences hearing us for the first time have some preconceived ideas of what they're going to hear. They usually expect old swing music to clap their fingers to. We do put some hot jazz standards on the programme, but also rock, even grunge and classical music, and a lot of music that is hard to define stylistically. <p/> We're one of those bands for whom word of mouth does most of the publicity, or at least it has so far. Everyone who has been to one of our concerts comes to the next one with their friends so they can see how they react. Usually people expect our concert to be pretty okay, but then they overlook it and say - aha - get rid of their preconceptions, relax and enjoy the concert. <p/> Does it open up a new musical world for them? <p/> That's right. A well-known theatre producer was brought to our concert by his wife. We met after the concert and he said that he didn't actually want to go to the concert, but after the concert he was delighted because it was immensely entertaining. He pointed out that even though we only use the ukulele and voice in our concerts, we showcase our talent and our ability to entertain and communicate with the audience at a high level. <p/>I don't think there is anything wrong with our concerts, we love the ukulele, we love the music even more and of course we love a good time. And if we are having fun, the audience is usually having fun with us. <p/> How do other musicians see you when they see you playing these toy-like guitars? <p/> We've had a lot of compliments from musicians. We try to make sure that there is something for everyone at our concerts, from a wide range of musical styles and performance styles. <p/>We notice that some people can appreciate certain approaches and song arrangements, especially our famous mixing of musical styles, sometimes even in one song, while others cannot. Some like the humour, others enjoy uncovering the musical layers and pieces of the song that we mix. <p/> Is it difficult to stay serious with instruments like that? <p/> It's possible to be serious with any instrument. The ukulele is just an instrument. It can be played a lot, like an organ, a string quartet or a mobile phone. <p/> Sometimes we play with the misconception that the ukulele is a toy or a joke. Although we try to present our music in a fun way, it is played well and bouncy, ecstatic, sometimes even reaching to the heart. <p/> You travel and perform a lot around the world. How do audiences react when they see and hear you? <p/> As a rule, the audience reacts the same everywhere, in Japan, in the US, in New Zealand... Our concert at Carnegie Hall was rated by the New York Times as one of the five best concerts that year in that prestigious hall. We usually get a standing ovation and calls to play an encore or two. I wonder how our style of music will be received by the Slovenian audience. <p/> How do you go about reworking classical and pop pieces for the ukulele? <p/> We play all kinds of music. Classical pieces are first approached with arrangements, usually written by me, then it's the orchestra's turn. We have to find the right way to translate the symphonic orchestral sound into the sound of the ukulele orchestra - for example, the sound of the harp in the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker and the sound of the brass in Jezza Valkyrie were a particular challenge. Usually with special and not always easy techniques we successfully convey the spirit of the music. Sometimes the notes fit, as in a military march, but sometimes reinterpretation is necessary. Because we mostly respect the music and the lyrics, we take more freedom in the arrangements and the choice of musical genre. Have any authors ever been offended when they heard your version of their song? <p/> A few times it really came to our ears that some composers or record companies were not impressed with our version. But most of them like it because we pay them the copyright. (Laughs. ) <p/> Because we write our own songs and we are a record label, we can do anything. We've done live shows with Yusuf Islam, who used to be known as Cat Stevens, with the Kaiser Chiefs, and we were special guests on the Madness album. David Bowie said we're fun and clever, and Brian Eno said we could be the turning point or the end point in the history of modern popular music. That is a joke that only works in English. (Laughs. ) Has anyone been very impressed by your version? <p/>When we appeared at the same festival as Wheatus and they found out we were going to play their hit Teenage Dirtbag, they insisted that we join them on stage and we sang that song together. Your performances need skilled ears that know the history of both popular and classical music. Sometimes you combine a number of fragments of different songs into one piece. <p/>I am sure that someone who doesn't know much about music will easily enjoy our concert, but the music connoisseur will of course find additional pleasure and a range of undertones. You don't need any special knowledge to listen to our music, but if you have a little more knowledge, you can get more out of the concert. Many people say that our work is multifaceted, which means that the enjoyment can be multifaceted too. What kind of programme have you prepared for the concert at Križanke? <p/> A delightful, stomping, clapping, singing, dancing and enchanting journey through the history of music. As we say in English - ""one plucking thing after another"". We are on a world tour, travelling with hand luggage only, and we hope to give the audience at least some of what they expect, some of what they need, and some surprises they don't know they need.",Interview

The book is the first of its kind in Slovenia and shows the development of symbols up to the time when European coats of arms, including the Slovenian one, first appeared. The first part of the book ends with his proposal for a Slovenian coat of arms, which he also explains in detail.

"A touch of heaven at the oratory animators' meeting <p/> Veržej <p/> 11.03.2017 <p/> The Handicraft Centre was filled to the brim with a slightly different kind of craftspeople this time. Don Bosco would certainly have said that these are the craftsmen of the shaping of human souls. The animators of the Oratories of the Diocese of Murcia and Sofia were gathered to learn about this year's Oratory, entitled ""Touch of Heaven"". <p/> In various workshops, they learned about the story, games, songs and catecheses of Mary, the main character of this year's Oratory. They listened attentively and participated in the presentations. We can only hope that this year's oratorio will also be a time of laughter and spiritual recharging for thousands of young people in this part of Slovenia. In his opening greeting, Peter Pučnik wished the animators and leaders to imitate Mary, to be able to listen to God's call and to welcome it into their hearts.
