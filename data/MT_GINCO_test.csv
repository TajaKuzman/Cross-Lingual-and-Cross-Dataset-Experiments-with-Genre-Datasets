"OUT FIT <p/> OUTFIT is a unique workout based on functional training. The special feature is the implementation of outdoor exercise. The mode of exercise and the underlying principles span the different exercise segments and are thus integrated into a whole. Therefore, OUTFIT is a workout where all the most important principles of modern exercise are worked out: coordination, body shaping, gaining fitness, strength, balance, stabilisation, flexibility, etc. It also differs from other functional workouts because of the emphasis on prevention and supervised execution of exercises. The point is to do something good for your body (to achieve as much as possible in a training period, in the best possible way). The workout is suitable for everyone, as it is uniquely adaptable to advanced exercisers as well as beginners. In the fresh air, you're sure to find something to love in 75 minutes of exercise. <p/> The workout consists of a functional warm-up, alphabet run, dynamic stretching. The main part of the challenge is mainly exercises for strength, flexibility, coordination, explosiveness, which are interconnected in an interesting sequence of exercises, separated by intensity or programmed in intervals, for the best possible results and a significant progress of the individual from term to term. This part of the term is about shaping the body and identifying personal weaknesses, with a clear outcome where progress is needed. After the main part of the session, there is stretching and relaxation. In any case, the main focus of the whole workout is to gain general fitness and improve the functionality of the body. <p/> The workout is supervised by the Bodifit team, who are available for advice and consultation before and after the workout. <p/> The aim of the supervision and the design of each training session is to ensure that the exercises are performed correctly and adapted to the individual's performance, fitness and body structure. The latter is often neglected in all the trendy emphasis on functional training and the flood of different exercise offers. However, it should not be forgotten that this is essential for injury prevention and optimal achievement of goals. An effective, fun and unique way to exercise outdoors, Bodifit's novelty is sure to take you by storm and become a permanent fixture during the spring and summer months. <p/> All you have to do is book your place on the date, enjoy the outdoors and surrender to the energy of the excellent Bodifit team, and you'll be eager to keep on exercising.",Promotion
"The weather has not been kind to football activities lately, but the pitch has been cleared and we are back in Ljudski vrt on Saturday. ""Since January we have had big problems in the training process because of the weather conditions. Back then we could have substituted some dates with a different training session, which we cannot do now, but we are well prepared regardless,"" says Darko Milanič, looking forward to the continuation of the season. <p/> And it is the next opponent that is among the most desirable. During Friday's match preview in front of the press microphones, the coach was asked if he could remember the last time we finished as losers against Velenje? ""I hope I will be asked the same question before the next game against Rudar,"" he smiled and continued seriously: ""Rudar confirmed their quality during our match in Velenje. They were really restrained as hosts in the first half, we had a lot of chances, but then they showed a different face, which we have also seen in other matches. This is a good warning for us ahead of Saturday's game, but as a whole we have more quality. Having said that, we have been without a game for a long time and we are already missing the competitiveness, so we are all together looking forward to another test where we want to start a new winning streak. We have worked hard to maximise our performance and behave as we did in the autumn in the domestic championship. "" <p/> Alongside the injured Timothy Dodlek, the team will be without the "" yellowed "" Nusmir Fajic. "" He was in great shooting form, unfortunately he will not be there this time, but we have also worked these two weeks to make sure that all players are effective. We have several foreigners at our disposal and I will decide who to give a chance. Ibraimi is also back tired, he has two national team games in a row and six club games before that, and we will see what condition he will be in on Saturday. """,News
"Nourishing masks from your home kitchen <p/> Honey with grapes effectively removes skin oil <p/> Make nourishing masks with ingredients you have at home Photo: Shutterstock.com <p/> The best thing you can give your face in summer is a nourishing mask that quickly nourishes your sun-dried skin while cushioning many other discomforts. <p/> Avocado and carrots <p/> The ideal nourishing mask for all skin types can be made with a mashed cooked carrot, half a mashed avocado and a tablespoon of olive oil.

"Overeating in secret <p/> Bulimia - an eating disorder in which a person is preoccupied with the appearance of his or her body and has a fear of becoming fat - which was only defined in 1980, is affecting more and more people. According to statistics, more than five per cent of the population officially suffer from this eating disorder, but in reality many more do. Like anorexia, bulimia affects more women than men, up to eight times more. Unlike anorexia, a person suffering from bulimia can conceal their distress for much longer than an anorexic person, as they tend to have a normal to moderate weight gain. The BMI of anorexics is very low, while that of bulimics ranges from 20 to 25. <p/> Huge amounts of food <p/> A characteristic of bulimia is repeated overeating, which occurs over a very short period of time. During this time, the person eats huge amounts of food, changing all the flavours from sweet, bitter, salty, sour... When he overeats, he feels guilty and induces his own vomiting, often with the help of laxatives and diuretics. Overeating and vomiting are cyclical, recurring several times a week. Most people who suffer from bulimia (75 %) belong to the so-called purgative type, which is characterised by overeating, vomiting and laxative use. The non-purgative type (25 per cent), on the other hand, indulges in fasting and excessive physical activity after binge eating. In bulimia, the person cannot control himself or herself, and therefore cannot choose the appropriate amount and type of food. However, it should be noted that most people who are overweight do not suffer from bulimia.",Information/Explanation

But only by a percent or two. But it's true that Mafia is an older game than VC. Maybe the next GTA will even catch up. But for once, Mafia is better for me. <p/> yes, in mafia it's a pain in the ass when you shoot a thomson for half an hour to kill a mafioso with a shkifarska and then shoot three times to kill him!!! cars go like tractors but it's true that mafia has the advantage that you can learn how to steal cars first!!! and when you walk by a bayti you'll see that everything is a bit strange but when it comes to GTA you can copy bayti!!!not to mention the fact that you drive a car in a skiff, and when you're not in the car, the skiff can see exactly how much you're driving when they had radar even back then!!! and you don't even have to get on a boat, but you still drive around!!! if I had more time, I'd be happy to discuss what mistakes there are in the mafia, and besides, GTA isn't without its faults!!!!!! so that you don't think that I'm defending GTA when you're at the beginning of the game and when you're on the phone, the phone is huge and when you're on the phone, you can also k**** into cars after having sex, and you can k**** it !!! so I like GTA better!!! maybe mafia 2 will be better than GTA and probably it will be!!! but when there will be a new GTA, it seems to me that mafia will be a lot of slapstick!!!!!!! we'll see!!!GTA IS THE LAW <p/> yeah you forget that sometimes the cars were really so slow and after the end you get better and very fast cars if you turn mafia 100% you get one car called crazy horse and it's impossible to drive because it's fast... besides you can put it on the back tyres... CRAZY <p/> yes angel you are right,if you turn around the game itself and the Lucas Bertone quests and Free Ride Extreme the game is even more interesting <p/> gee I can't stand to see your pointless posts comparing mafia to vice city. you can't compare two spiels like that in graphics and gameplay. you can't compare two spiels like that in graphics and gameplay. each has its own story and each takes place in a different time, which also explains the cars and their speeds. bOy; no spiel is without its faults, and mafia is also an older spiel, about 1 year old, so please. not with such meaningless comments!!!! <p/> didn't you even read it or did you lose your glasses???? i wrote that in GTA their phone is huge so before you write anything you can even read it!!!!and i didn't say that GTA is bug free but we are at the end of 2003 not 2222!!!!",Forum

"NSI and SDS: Mojca Kucler Dolinar wants to give Ljubljana new substance <p/> Tuesday, 28.2.2012 <p/> At today's press conference, Mojca Kucler Dolinar presented her candidacy for mayor of Ljubljana. She began by stressing that Ljubljana needs new leadership, freshness, economy and responsibility. At the press conference, her candidacy was endorsed by representatives of New Slovenia and the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS): Anton Kranjc, representative of the NSi City Committee, Dragutin Mate, President of the SDS City Committee, Dr Žiga Turk, Minister of Education, Culture and Sport, Aleš Hojs, Minister of Defence, and the Director of the Government Communications Office, Mag. Anže Logar. <p/> As she said in her opening remarks, from the very beginning of the identification process, she has been working to bring the Spring Spring Day parties together to agree on a joint candidacy. Both the initiative and the support then came from the ranks of the Slovenian Democratic Party. The candidacy is first and foremost the result of her personal decision. The candidacy is a particular challenge for her - she is familiar with the mayoralty, having followed it closely as a city councillor, and as such is well acquainted with Ljubljana's burning issues. After all, she is also a resident of old Ljubljana, which has become a beautiful city centre in recent years, but looks are not everything. Behind it are many problems that citizens face on a daily basis. . <p/> There are still a number of deliberately inflicted injuries to the Ljubljana organism that will have to be treated, which have been covered up in the past with many ""beauty operations"". Since we do not want to look for a receiver for Ljubljana in the next regular mayoral elections, we need to elect a good steward in this one - one who will spend money for the benefit of all Ljubljana citizens, who will conscientiously manage the city's land, who will carefully protect the reputation of public companies, who will carry out tenders transparently, who will select contractors responsibly and who will make sure that every subcontractor is paid fairly. The New Slovenia and the Slovenian Democratic Party are behind all of the above, as they have already demonstrated by their performance in the City Council. <p/> Mojca Kucler Dolinar concluded her announcement of her candidacy for Mayor of Ljubljana with her desire to show an alternative to what has happened in Ljubljana so far that is good, effective and puts the people of the capital at the centre. <p/> Dragutin Mate, President of the SDS City Committee, endorsed Dolinar as an excellent candidate who knows Ljubljana very well and has a lot of experience, which is a guarantee that she will be a good steward of Ljubljana and that she will introduce the necessary changes to improve the lives of the citizens of Ljubljana. He stressed the cooperation of both parties in the preparation of the programme. <p/> Anton Kranjc, representative of the NSi City Committee, stressed that Kucler Dolinar is the best choice at this moment because she has experience, she knows how to lead, she knows how to communicate. She knows exactly what is right and what is wrong, and she stands for honesty and sincerity. <p/> City Councillor Anže Logar (SDS) pointed out that Kucler Dolinar has always been an active City Councillor - including as Vice-Chair of the Commission on Mandate Issues, Elections and Appointments, which she now chairs, she supports a lively debate from the point of view of morality and ethics for the benefit of Ljubljana, and would like to see this kind of debate in the City Council as well. In his words, the candidate stands for the power of argument, not for the argument of power. <p/> Minister of Defence Aleš Hojs (NSi) is pleased to see the joint support of the NSi and the SDS. He sees in the candidate the possibility of change for the better and the realisation of the fundamental programme of New Slovenia: ""The word is valid. <p/> Minister Dr Žiga Turk (SDS) stressed that Ljubljana deserves a good mayor who is honest, capable and enthusiastic like Kucler Dolinar. Under her leadership, the city can continue what has been good in the past and break with the bad practices of recent mandates.",News

"Last Tuesday, 23 April 2013, Slovenian brands Marta Vodeb, Terra Urbana, Nelizabeta and Urša Zrnec and Pentlja by Goga presented their jewellery collections at the Emporium Gallery. <p/> On a beautiful spring evening, the Gallery prepared a magical event, which was opened on the ground floor by Marta Vodeb. Mannequins walked down the Gallery's imposing staircase to the sound of Slovenian evergreen melodies, dressed in the Girl from the Golden Boat collection in silk, lace and wool and adorned with short sleeves, bows and pearls. The collection is romantic, delicate and nostalgic and worthy of praise. <p/> Upstairs, Terra Urbana brings nature to life. Inspired by the world of butterflies, the Dragonfly Married Butterfly SS2013 collection is a blend of tenderness with strength, tradition with trend and fabrics that are friendly to people and nature. <p/> Upstairs, the evergreens were replaced by thumping electronic music, while the escalators served as the prefect backdrop for both the summer and part of the winter 2013/14 collection by Nelizabeta. The summer collection was inspired by the 1920s, art deco and sports fashion, while the winter collection was inspired by the national costumes of the former Yugoslavia and military uniforms. Not only the clothes, but also the shoes and bags are the work of designer Neli Štrukelj. All the products are made in the Nelizabeta team's home workshop in Sežana, where they combine the experience of the old masters with modern technology and innovation. The summer and autumn/winter collections are most impressive for the coats. <p/> On the ground floor, we also saw Urša Zrnec's glass jewellery and Pentlja by Goga in vibrant neon colours that scream summer. <p/> Petra Draškovič from Galeria Emporium told Fashionista.si that Slovenian designers are becoming more and more visible and marketable in the Gallery. Especially successful are the jewellery collections, which are also sought after by tourists and other visitors from abroad. However, she stressed that a lot also depends on the designer himself and his will to do something for the brand's recognition and promotion. ""At the Gallery we are proud to host Slovenian designers. Our doors are open to everyone, anyone can come to us, show us their collections and we assess whether they are of high enough quality and commercial enough for us to participate.

"WHICH MALE OF THE ZODIAC IS THE HARDEST TO GET OVER? <p/> Which zodiac sign is the man born in who is the hardest to get over, depending on the astro sign you were born in? <p/> Even though they're over and you want to treat him like all exes, somehow you can't forget about him. Just one thought of his smile, his joking remarks, the way he pronounced your name is enough to keep you from getting over him completely. Wondering what sign the man you may never get over is born in, depending on the zodiac sign you were born in? <p/> LIBRA GETS OVER LIBRA THE HARDEST <p/> A romantic man born in Libra is your opposite, so strong that you're incredibly attracted to him even if you've ended the relationship. You can relive your great chemistry for years to come and no other man is as attentive as a Libra when it comes to intimate relationships. His graceful Venusian energy will long remain in the memory of the sheep, triggering the warmth that the sheep, although acting all-powerful and stable, constantly craves. <p/> Taurus is the hardest Sagittarius to forget <p/> Astrologically speaking, when Taurus and Sagittarius come together they create an element of tension, but this is precisely the reason why Taurus will not forget the spontaneous, resourceful and kind Sagittarius for a long time to come. Although they are not fundamentally compatible, a Taurus is never bored around a Sagittarius. She can relinquish control around him, which is not easy for her. When she tries to get over him, there's a problem, because she finds that she misses his messiness. <p/> Gemini is the hardest to beat in Capricorn <p/> At first glance, Gemini and Capricorn have nothing in common, but when you look a little deeper, you realise that for the distracted and irresponsible Gemini, the persistent and consistent Capricorn is the perfect match, especially if she wants to put certain areas of her life in order. When they break up, the twin perceives it all as a deep hurt, knowing that no other man will motivate her so self-sacrificingly and persistently to be consistent in her struggles and thus more successful and content. <p/> CANCER HURTS FASTEST OF FISH <p/> Cancer is one of the most sentimental zodiac signs, and after it we rank Pisces. Both signs focus on relationships and together they move into deep emotional perceptions that others may not be able to perceive. When a relationship with a Pisces man ends, it can leave a big hole in her life, as she can't connect with any other man as deeply as she can with a Pisces. <p/> LEVINS HAVE THE HARDEST TIME GETTING OVER AQUARIUS <p/> Leo has the hardest time getting over the free-spirited and resourceful Aquarius. He is her cosmic doppelganger who teaches her how to act independently and how to appreciate all values, especially friendship. Aquarius energy has a strong influence on Leo, complementing and encouraging her in everyday things. When she thinks of him, she misses his wit most of all, which must have made her laugh and smile many times. <p/> VIRGO HARDEST TO WAKE UP TWIN <p/> Virgo and Gemini tend to get on well at first because of their mutual love of intellectual pursuits. Because they stimulate each other mentally and can talk for hours about anything, it is the twin who the Virgo misses the most when she ends the relationship with him, or finds it hard to get over. When he is no longer with her, she starts to miss his sarcastic teasing and incredible curiosity. <p/> LIBRA HARDEST TO GET OVER Taurus <p/> Libra is strongly linked to Taurus because of their shared ruling planet Venus. When the relationship ends, Libra misses Taurus, who has always been stable and determined, and she also misses his stubbornness. Libra will find it hard to get over Taurus, especially those beautiful romantic moments together that were like the most beautiful fairy tale. When Libra is completely free, she often misses the bull's control. <p/> Scorpio is the hardest Aries to get over <p/> Scorpio is the hardest Aries to get over, both are ruled by Mars, which means they are incredibly passionate. Scorpio will miss Aries, even though there have been various clashes between them all along. Without Aries, she may be bored. Scorpio will find it hard to find the kind of intense dynamic that she has with Aries with other signs. She misses Aries most when she goes to bed at night. <p/> Sagittarius is the hardest to impress for a Leo <p/> Sagittarius and Leo are enthusiastic, spontaneous and have a desire to live life to the full. Both are independent and always understand the other's need for space. When a Sagittarius ends a relationship with a Leo, what she misses most is his ease and incredible understanding of her way of life. Although Sagittarians find themselves quickly in a new relationship, it will take them longer to get over the Leo, if they ever do get over him completely. <p/> CAPRICORN GETS OVER CANCER THE HARDEST <p/> Capricorn is very serious and needs someone to get her riled up. Cancer is the one who constantly gives her a youthful, innocent and gentle energy that definitely brings out the feminine part of Capricorn. Capricorn misses Cancer the most because it has taught her many things, including how to give herself completely in a love relationship. Cancer is hard to get over because without it, she finds it difficult to find the right emotional balance. <p/> Aquarius finds it hardest to get over Scorpio <p/> Aquarius and Scorpio have almost nothing in common, which is why Scorpio is a great mystical enigma for Aquarius, even when the relationship ends. She misses him mainly because he is able to look at things and life in an impersonal and logical way, because he is uncomplicated and honest. Aquarius makes Scorpio feel the most beautiful and the best, and she misses his sexy compliments and passion, which is so important to her in a relationship. <p/> FISH HURTS A GIRL the hardest <p/> Pisces brings emotional depth to a relationship, so a man born in Virgo offers them stability. Pisces, although a hopeless romantic, misses Virgo for her meticulous, consistent and honest actions. When a relationship ends, the Pisces is very sad that she will no longer enjoy a loving relationship with a Virgo man who is sincere and filled with affection. Pisces also misses the working zeal and sense of the material that Virgo has.",Opinion/Argumentation

"Turkey, an economically highly developed country of more than 71 million people, has a remarkable history and culture and many well-preserved historical sites that are carefully maintained and cared for. Two of the most popular tourist destinations are the historic and picturesque seaside towns, which quickly captivate people with their oriental imagery. <p/> Antalya, with its riviera of long beaches, is sun-drenched for ten months of the year and is Turkey's main tourist asset. In the background, the mighty Taurus (Taurus Bull) mountains shield it from the northerly winds and hide a wealth of underground caves. It was founded by the ancient Greeks and still has its own walled quarter, as do the Jews, Christians and, of course, Muslims. Affluent Antalya is the largest city in the Mediterranean, and its population has exploded in recent decades. As recently as 1985, there were 261 000 inhabitants; now there are more than 1 200 000, and with the metropolitan area there are a million more. In addition, it hosts over ten million tourists every year. <p/> I started my walk through the old town of Kaleiçi from a vast platform with water towers and a monument to Atatürk, the reformist statesman who wanted to bring Turkey closer to Europe. Among other things, he introduced the Latin alphabet and rejected religious extremes, including the headscarf. Today, children climb his monument freely, and the country has gone off the rails. <p/> The platform overlooks the city centre, with its three mosques and a lone medieval brick-red minaret - the Yivli. I joined the strollers on the city promenade, where ice-cream makers keep the mood up - doing mischief with dondurma ice-cream on long sticks. And there I was, standing in the square in front of the Saat Kulesi clock tower, a good city landmark, turning off to the bustling bazaar among oriental smells and colourful stalls. I then continued to Hadrian's Gate, where I entered the Ottoman world from the modern part of the city. The gate in the city walls is a triumphal arch of three entrances, built in 130 AD when the then Roman Emperor visited the city. <p/> In Antalya's Old Town you can admire the sophisticated Ottoman architecture of the houses, which are home to lovely souvenir shops, galleries, small hotels and restaurants with romantic gardens. Older locals like to sit on the benches and walls, snoozing or playing their board games. <p/> Antalya has no town beach, as it is built on high cliffs. It does, however, have a charming little harbour, which is dangerous for boats in the winter months. Resting on a bench in Karaalioglu Park, near the 1st century red tower of Hidirlik, which still clings to the remains of the thick city walls, I noticed that old and young, Turkish and foreign, gather around here. I had a beautiful view of the harbour and Antalya on the cliffs. This park also ends at the sea with a steep cliff into which steps have been cut leading to small rocky platforms. <p/> The surroundings of Antalya offer plenty of opportunities for excursions as well as challenging sporting adventures. In the resort of Belek, there is a golf course stretching along the sea, along which we drove for more than half an hour, and there are areas for divers too. Not far away are historic towns such as Side, Myra, Alanya and others, where you can take public transport for a pittance. A visit to the park where the Manavgat River flows into the sea is unforgettable. Its refreshing waterfalls roar and spray droplets of water far out to sea, where they magically end in an arc of colourful rainbows. <p/> It's a story unto itself, the long Turkish Riviera, where one beach is as long as the Slovenian coast, with megalomaniacal hotel resorts, buildings like Harry Potter movies or replicas of Venice's St Mark's Square... <p/> Attractive Alanya <p/> Alanya is the oldest tourist town on the Turkish Riviera. It lies on the southern coast of Anatolia (Asia Minor) and is said to have been discovered by Cleopatra VII, the last Egyptian Pharaoh. She loved to visit here with her husband Marc Antony and their three children. One of the town's three beaches is still named after her - Cleopatra's Beach. Here, fine sand fills the turquoise sea. The pebbly beach flows east into the peninsula that divides Alanya in two. The peninsula rises steeply to a rocky hill, green at the top and hiding the remains of a once mighty fortress. You can also take a gondola almost to the top. Within the castle walls, you will find the Byzantine church, the Suleiman Mosque and the caravanserai built by Suleiman the Magnificent. The castle, which was beautifully restored just over a decade ago, was built in 1226 by the Seljuk Sultans as their winter residence, but the hill was already inhabited during the Hittite Empire more than three thousand years ago. <p/> In the Middle Ages, under Sultan Aladdin Kejkubad I, the city enjoyed a golden age. In addition to the castle, several important buildings remain from those times, such as the Kizil Kule - the Red Watchtower, which stands in the harbour below the castle and is an outstanding example of medieval military architecture, and the Tersane shipyard. <p/> On the other side of the peninsula is the town's harbour, once a favourite haunt of the notorious Mediterranean pirates. In the town, you can see the former Atatürk Villa, a fine example of Ottoman architecture. We also visited the fascinating Müze Museum, which illustrates the many civilisations of Anatolia. In the museum park, peacocks roam and strut among the remains of Roman statues and Islamic tombstones. The city thrives on tourism, and not far away is the famous Damlatas underground cave, which is said to be beneficial for asthmatics. <p/> Rich country, poor people <p/> Turkey has lush vegetation and fertile soil so that they can grow all their own food, much of it exported to the wider world. In Antalya, the masses of white-tiled greenhouses that stretch beyond the city to the foot of Taurus are visible from the plane, and there are no shortage of them among the hotel resorts. <p/> It is well known that the east of the country is poorer than the west, where there are a good number of millionaires and even 37 billionaires. However, the general impression is that, although the country is rich, they have quite a few poor people. But they have a great joie de vivre, because there are many children and young people, and everybody respects the elderly and likes to socialise with each other in large numbers. <p/> In the parks, you don't see walkers, cyclists, passionate joggers like in our country, not even people with dogs. Man's best friends live there in freedom. They are all chipped, probably neutered, and a little bit shorthaired, and they roam around happily. Incidentally, the Turks breed the Anatolian Shepherd Dog, a brave herding dog used in some African countries to guard livestock against wild beasts. <p/> The Turkish language is difficult, but thanks to the many TV series, some of the words are familiar. The first records of Old Turkic were found on Sumerian tablets, and analyses of these cuneiform tablets have shown that the language is one of the oldest recorded languages. What's more, Turks understand and still use 1200 of these ancient words. Some Slovenian words originate from Turkish, such as pavilion, kiosk, hut, yurt, tent, divan, sofa, sofa, canteen, bag, cap, pocket, top, fool, kayak, etc., and words referring to gastronomy (cevapčičič, baklava, kebab, ajvar, yoghurt, coffee, sour cherries, corn) or to horse equipment (bridle, hamat). Last but not least, we have some Turkish surnames such as Tur(e)k, Intihar, Hodalič, Jančar, Kordiž, Mankoč, Oman, Šalamun and others. There are also a few place names that remind us of Turkish times, such as Tabor, Grmada, Hudo, and even Ljubljana's Bežigrad was named after a Turkish refugee who camped there before the siege of Ljubljana.",Opinion/Argumentation
"Some time ago I decided to go in for rainwater tanks. Since I have a garden, and since last year - as usual - the water ran out, and I intend to enlarge the garden this year, I had no choice but to buy this thing and get water for the rainy days. First of all, I was looking at flea cisterns. Then I sent out some enquiries for new cisterns. Finally, I found black tanks, the price was good, and I bought two. As the seller was willing to bring the two tanks to me, I squeezed his hand for another EUR 10 for the transport and the deal was done. Then the work began. <p/> On the first day we dug up one huge bush. We not only dug it up, we also broke it down into several smaller ones and on the second day we planted these smaller bushes by the road in another part of the garden. The next day we dug up the ornamental grass and planted it also in smaller pieces in another part of the garden (nothing goes away here). On the third day, we dug the soil for the trellis I had imagined. As the ground is uneven and I want the cisterns to be higher than the ground, they had to be raised. On the fourth day we made the trusses and then waited five days for 4 euros so that we could buy two knees for the gutter and finish the job. <p/> We waited five days for those 4 euros... :) You don't know whether to laugh or cry. On Tuesday I went to the ATM to see if by any chance any virtual money had come in, and yesterday when I checked again, it said that the card was blocked. Oops... the money was in the account, but how to get it and what happened on that night from Tuesday to Wednesday, I wondered. Lo and behold, the execution from Durs arrived. The contributions for the Social Insurance Institution, which I hadn't paid by the due date. I knew that would be the case, but I was kind of hoping that I would get the EUR 600 I had left (I had already paid EUR 700) before they remembered me. The important thing is that I paid the loan and that I still have some money left for the essentials, and the EUR 120 that the banks have charged me for the blocking, the execution and the costs, I will also have to swallow. In short, when I got the 4 euros, we could finish the job. Thank you... <p/> I know, yes, the plastic is not very pretty to look at, but I'm going to do some studying. First I need to see how the inox or whatever is around this plate heats up, then I'll either just cover the tanks with bamboo or plant some ivy around it. In any case, it will not stay as it is. Otherwise, I like it. The garden is right next door, the v-tank holds 1000 l, and the field is a little further on. It has to grow like a ludo, I would say.",Opinion/Argumentation
"Before the end of the old year, fashion designer Jessica Jagec presented her Spring Summer 2013 collection at the LP bar, accompanied and supported by Tinkara Kovač (before the show started, singer Tinkara Kovač presented a track from her new album Rastemo). Proof that fashion and music are friends that go hand in hand and complement each other. The key concept of Jessica's femininity is fatality. <p/> The show started with a fashion video hinting at the upcoming collection. Maja Fučak and Nataša Janežič Žagar are the faces of Jessica's collection. <p/> During the process, she looked inward and asked herself what she wanted and what she didn't want. What is her world view and what does she want to offer to the consumers of her style. <p/> She started with the romantic Rococo period, which she interpreted into modern times. So, Rococo in the 21st century. She linked the historical period with Futurism, and the cuts themselves swear by constructivist principles. The colour palette features shades of greys, as well as electric blues and shimmering greys. The silhouettes are tailored to the female body, emphasising it, telling a story about it, not disfiguring it. Sharp symmetrical jackets and off-the-shoulder dresses, on the other hand, are replaced by light, asymmetrical dresses with white and blue floral prints. <p/> The richness and variety of the different garments allow for constant mixing and matching. <p/> During the design itself, we see a game of revealing and concealing and the woman who will wear it allows herself some clothing experimentation and has a clear vision of herself.

"Association members: <p/> Knowing your customers and knowing what they are buying based on is very important in building a successful and strong relationship with each other. <p/> People often make a decision to buy a product based on their own emotional experience. When you develop a relationship with your customers there are many opportunities when you can influence their emotions. The kind of relationship you build with them depends on the kind of emotional environment you create. <p/> You can also use these steps when thinking about the right promotional product for your customers. Ask yourself which promotional gift would excite them and encourage them to buy a particular sales item. Be sensitive to the customer's needs. Your job is to give them a pleasant experience. <p/> This is just one of the tips we've put together to help you boost your sales. At Axis Mundi, we know the problems you face in sales promotion and we feel a responsibility to help you with our years of experience, knowledge and ideas. We have many years of experience with various companies in Slovenia and we specialise in advising different industries.

Our sales consultants will be happy to advise you and help you choose the right promotional gift for your customers. <p/> Promotional products are still a great way to attract new customers. In an era where modern technology is reducing the impact of many forms of media advertising, promotional products are becoming increasingly important for reaching new customers. <p/> Why promotional products are still effective Retailers are increasingly using promotional products to attract new customers because of their usefulness. Television, as an advertising medium, is increasingly under threat with the rise of new TV channels, and it is easy for viewers to skip adverts. In the case of a promotional product, the advertisement cannot be skipped, as it is part of the product and is visible whenever the product is used. <p/> Promotional product manufacturing on the rise Today, promotional product manufacturing is booming because it offers advertisers what many other advertising methods do not, i.e. your message is guaranteed to reach the desired population. Despite the many messages we bombard our potential customers with, advertising with promotional products is effective because many of the messages are internalised. For a message to be internalised by customers, it needs to be repeated many times. A promotional product with its own message is the ideal way to achieve this. <p/> Targeting and measurability Internet advertising makes it easy to reach your target audience and monitor the impact of your advertising campaign. We can do the same with the right promotional product. For example, we print a unique promotional code on the promotional product, which then helps us calculate how much we have recouped our investment. <p/> Promotional products as part of your promotional plan Promotional products will continue to be just one part of your marketing plan, but they play a very important role and should not be overlooked. Promotional products are a great way to make a service tangible and achieve brand awareness through constant messaging. <p/> UK - A 2011 survey by The British Promotional Merchandise Association (BPMA) showed that marketers much prefer to buy practical promotional products that have been proven to be good and effective in the past. These Top 3 products include pens, notepads and post-it notes, and canvas shopping bags or ECO bags. <p/> When asked how they get the promotional products they want, almost 70 respondents said that the supplier they currently work with is a key source of information. <p/> Despite the fact that more and more money is being spent on marketing, more and more companies want newer and more original ways of promotion to differentiate themselves from the rest. Products made from environmentally friendly materials have become increasingly important in recent years. Eco promotional products not only increase sales and brand awareness, but also communicate what kind of company you are. <p/> Read the full article on the new eco-guidelines that the promotional products industry is following at www.ppiblog.com.",Promotion
"For your consideration... <p/> I belong to that school of modern observers who believe that the world is at a turning point. In the course of history we have repeatedly lost confidence in eternal truths. Among them, in religion, in the State and in the world being flat. Today, we are giving up this trust to the market as we knew it until recently. The most radical language of new values and demands for a reorganisation of the system is spoken today by civil society initiatives. They do not see the existing model of market capitalism as the solution for a sustainable and just society. A new language is also being spoken by a growing part of the economy, which is adapting its business models, attitudes and value creation processes to values and co-creating them in dialogue with the needs of the people. Social and economic value creation processes are being reinvented, based on self-organisation, commodity exchange, participatory and democratic forms of ownership. The present is beginning to speak a language that holds the promise of radical change for the better. <p/> Not many people speak this language, but they are increasingly being heard. Because we all want to believe that something better is possible. Because we need to believe that better can always be (more) possible. <p/> We all understand part of this language. Some say it is useless, that it is outdated. Others believe that it can only partially explain and justify the needs of modern society. Still others add new slogans to enrich it and throw out concepts that do not belong. We seem to be reassembling the alphabet of the world. And, given the current indicators of the overall balance sheet, this is more than necessary. What this alphabet will bring will be determined by the concrete actions and changes that this new language will trigger. We can still hope that we are living in times of change. <p/> As we write this first blog entry, it is also our first text entry dedicated to the online community that has started to coalesce in recent months around the people who co-create the Vive mission [ 1 ]. In the period behind us, this community has taken small but courageous steps towards the goal of a better life that defines us as a collective, as collaborators, as colleagues, as friends, as a community. While we are aware that we could not have set ourselves a broader goal than a better life, we are slowly realising that this goal has very clear trajectories. <p/> In the process of defining our values, fleshing out our goals and strategising our work plan, we have continually stumbled over the breadth of the notion of a better life. What values bind us together as a community of colleagues? Which values are those that represent our minimum common denominator? How do we offer something truly new, something that is our product, in a crowd of organisations, ideas and activities that all promise us a better life? <p/> If, after this paragraph, you think that we have found all the answers, we must disappoint you. We haven't. Not all of them, anyway. But we are learning, every day, that there is incredible potential in our neighbourhood, from individuals with extraordinary ideas and innovative skills. That many organisations, initiatives and companies are making an invaluable contribution to the quality of life for all of us. These are all those who are working in different ways to create a world based on a just economy, who are breathing for us to eat better, healthier and fairer food, who believe that we have the right to a better democracy and for whom health is a right, not just an individual responsibility.",Opinion/Argumentation

The bullet has a harder core and consequently there is less copper coating, Los abandoned this some time ago and has the opposite...Tolerances, weight within normal limits, but on every bullet in the box, there is a matrix imprint at the transition of the radius to the tip, this is yet to be corrected, Los had the same problem and now it is solved, because such a bullet can not go abroad................................................................................. Nothing special in shooting, loading, of course for something more I would use rest, but for ipsc not even...as a type of bullet RN clean ok product. Price of bullets...wins the Moose, bold <p/> And this is the thorough test for you that you were raving about a page back? Ma dej... A 25,000 shus/year man is expected to have a concrete test, not to wash you. <p/> Mozakar has no time or else he won't reach the 25,000 norm this year <p/> Otherwise, a month and a half ago I found about 45 rounds of 147 grain in a package of 124 grain LOS 9mm kugels, FP. So even the LOS big-bore will probably have to learn, if nothing else, how to pack kugels. Price for mortals through official channels-> I don't know if LOS wins. 32€ vs 34€, at Rebec. <p/> Yeah well it says if you read it...conclusions at a glance I don't know what you expect, the point is said I have no intention of bothering with this really...why don't you give it a try yourself <p/> Great no...you'll have to learn a lot too, until then buy Arma bullets.... <p/> No I didn't buy them, if you're interested. I've bought quite a lot of LOS already, and I'm not going to stop because of this mistake. It just happens. You don't have to be a smartass like you to praise one, you probably get a ton of it for free. And especially in the Armaforce thread, when someone asked about those bullets, not the LOS. I get on LOS' nerves sometimes just because of your stupid crap. <p/> Just a quick comparison of one and the other was made, I gave my findings, but if you take that as bragging I can't help you, a hundred people are a hundred wonders <p/> Yeah well, it says here, if you read....you're the one bitching about a thorough test not me.So don't throw your fake tests at me. <p/> But you're not happy with the whole world, come on, be a little positive sometime, what is it man, what do you want to prove... I gave my findings, wrote that I had no intention of dealing with it and suggested that you find out for yourself if it's in your interest... my answer was not to your liking, you gave me a minus, you got it back... here's the way it goes in the new year <p/> The Master made the only sensible comment. The others are well below the level. I thought this was typical of jagras. But I see you are cutting us down. Armaforce made a big mistake by posting the LOS pictures. These are just marketing ploys of modern entrepreneurs. Any publicity is good, even if it is negative. It is naive to think that this was a mistake. If they know how to package the bullets (excellent packaging) then they should know how to present them to the shooters. This work was then done free of charge by Tine. You are asking for a detailed test from Apple. Why would the competition test their bullets at all? You are the top experts here on the pile. And yet you dispute Apple's brief quick findings. I am happy for any new manufacturer. But I buy the one that answers my questions. Price and quality. I have no dilemmas. Do you? <p/> Ah, I told you why ipsc is considered the king of marksmanship...because of the strict adherence to the rules and the immediate DQ at the slightest violation of them...the marksmanship of the individual has nothing to do with it, the shooters who take part in these competitions are all kings, as you rightly pointed out, thank you thank you...they know how to handle their weapons according to the accepted rules, because there is no other way to do it. I know that for someone who hasn't been to these competitions it's completely alien, how else to understand posting an unacceptable video where you have your finger on the trigger when loading and unloading the gun.... Ps the video is under...[adjustable sights for rexs] but it would be better if it wasn't... if you're still wondering what you're hoping for the kings will explain :))) <p/> Apple if you look very well the finger is not on the trigger..

Everyone has their favourites. The thing with the Jags is that they are always looking for something new, something better. In short, a bullet that always hits without damaging the roast, and the game falls on the spot. And every new one is the best until it happens..... I also have good experience with both other manufacturers here. If anyone asks for an opinion I always praise them. In my opinion they are better than the much vaunted Barnes TTSX. I myself have been using LOS since the beginning. I recently killed an 80kg pig in the thick of it. Drop on the spot. Hit through the heart. Why would I buy an expensive one when this bullet has everything I need. You just have to hit it. But if I'm shooting at paper, it's hard to find a cheaper and more accurate one. And as long as that's the case, this bullet will be in my gun. You guys can keep switching all you want. <p/> I'm not picking on anyone :-P But if folks don't accept my thinking and can't argue back...that's not my problem. Me? prove it? I have nothing to prove.

"In the fashion world, there are supposed to be rules of dress that real fashion enthusiasts do not follow. What is right and what is wrong has recently become even more of a subjective decision for the individual, so it is right that we should also debunk some of the fashion myths that we have blindly followed up until now. Why is this happening? Because fashion history is unfolding in such a way that what was once fashionable, which has become unfashionable, is now ""in"" again. But with an innovative twist. <p/> Rule No.1 - Same shoes and same handbag <p/> Once such an important rule that we held sacred, but nowadays you can safely forget it. Where we used to be on the lookout for shoes that matched our handbag, now we look for shoes that complement, contrast or even just match in a small detail. Give yourself a break and treat yourself to a crazy combination of a neon handbag and floral sandals. <p/> Rule No. 2- Don't mix patterns <p/> Mix them up to no end! If the designers of famous brands and fashion gurus can mix them, then so can you. You can look for inspiration from designers like D&G, Betsey Johnson, Preen and Mary Katrantzou, and many more. If you can't find your own designs on the shelves of the more affordable clothing brands, there are fabulous designer goods available in metro stores where they can make you the garment you want. <p/> Rule No. 3 - The older you get, the more you ""cover up"" <p/> It's like life after 40 is over! The vast majority of women look much better in their 40s than many women in their 20s. And if you have all the attributes of youth, why hide them? If you still have perfect legs at 45, treat yourself to a knee-length skirt and heels. Just make sure you don't overdo it and don't dress in clothes designed for 20-year-olds. Mini-skirts only suit 20-year-old girls anyway. <p/> Rule No 4- Never wear tights or open-toed socks <p/> If you had dared to step out on the street in such an outfit a few years ago, you would have been met with a lot of ridicule and strange looks. But nowadays, many women are wearing this very combination! Take Rihanna or Alexa Chung, who have taken the fashion world by storm with their unique styles. Now it's time to pair your favourite tights with summer open toes and a short skirt. <p/> Rule No. 5 - underwear must never show through your clothes <p/> Remember when we used to hide our bra straps with fervor? Or better still, the whole bra, just so it wouldn't show. And when we came across the sheer material of a beautifully tailored blouse, we were in for a big surprise, precisely because of the visibility of the underwear.

"Advent is a time of anticipation. Preparations for this year's Christmas are upon us. Preparation requires a certain amount of cooperation and commitment on our part. We do not wait with our arms crossed. Only children behave like that, not knowing what to do and therefore bored. If I personally want to prepare for the holiday and also get the most out of the holiday, then I have to make a programme of what I want to achieve and then work hard to really achieve the goals I have set. I will not dwell on those for whom Christmas is just a nice family holiday, when they are at home more, when they are doing the gift-giving, when they are perhaps having a Christmas holiday together on the white slopes, but we will not see them in church for the holidays because they have no faith, or because they think they have done enough by putting up a Christmas tree and an artistic nativity scene at home. I will leave aside those things that have no connection with the Christian faith and instead dwell on the Slovenian traditional Christmas celebration. What goals can I set myself in preparation for Christmas? For some, Christmas will be a time to reminisce about old times, to think about childhood and time with parents and family traditions. So they will put up the nativity scene and the Christmas tree, bless the premises in the old way, say a prayer and have a good dinner. At midnight, they will probably attend a midnight feast. It will be a really nice revival of an old tradition, and many will enjoy it. With this revival of old customs and traditions, the question that comes to my mind is: What benefit will this bring me? To what extent will these old traditions change and transform me? What will this new preparation for Christmas bring me that will make my everyday life different, richer, calmer and more meaningful? The beautiful old traditions are certainly necessary because they speak of our historical memory, which is necessary and we should not be ashamed of. Beautiful traditions are the wealth of a nation, and it is right to preserve and revive them. However, it seems to me that this will not bring into my daily life the new things that will challenge me, because they will offer me new content, because they will require me to bring into the Advent preparation for Christmas the novelties that are part of me, linked to my thinking and feeling. In this way, Christmas will no longer be just a nice old folklore, but will have a touch of the contemporary, of my personal life. Analysts have noted that man, especially Western man, and thus also Slovenian man, is increasingly losing his soul because he has allowed himself to be so drawn in by materialism that he can no longer shake it off. Materialism is like a terrible anaconda, a serpent that wraps itself around its victim and squeezes him so that he can no longer escape from its embrace. This squeezing of the serpent gets worse and worse by the moment, as it breaks the victim's bones, and in the end she suffocates, all numb. To live a more free life worthy of man, it is necessary to get out of this embrace and to put a limit to materialism. We must realise that money must not be our master, but on the contrary, we must be its master, we must put a limit to consumerism. Advent preparation for Christmas therefore consists first of all in making a careful analysis of my ordinary life. I must see clearly and evaluate my desires and expectations, but I must also be aware of my limits and my delusions. Both need to be put on the scales and to see which way the scales tip: if there are too many negative things, action needs to be taken immediately. Any delay will only lead to a growing alienation from oneself, from one's neighbours and from God. Any persistence in negative things leads to more and more dependence. At a certain point, you have to tell yourself that the time has come to get rid of all that weighs you down, takes away your freedom and harms you. It is necessary to remove all these things and say loud and clear to yourself: 'Why should I harm myself! I don't want to see this anymore! ""The strong will that is awakened by this then needs to be strengthened more every day. It is necessary to reckon with God, it is necessary to reckon with the power of prayer, and above all it is necessary to deepen faith. Only he who believes in God is then able to throw himself into God's arms, to confess his guilt and sins and to forgive first himself and then his neighbour. This is the only way we can purify ourselves and free ourselves from the past that presses us to the ground and does not let us breathe freely. We must first forgive ourselves, gain respect and trust, so that we can then forgive our neighbours and finally be reconciled to God. This is the only way to breathe more freely. Any search for any other means that does not take into account man's guilt and purify it with God's forgiveness and mercy is doomed to failure. So let us not fall for the various Internet offers that promise a quick solution. This is just a waste of money without any real effect. Why not rather cling to God, who demands no payment for Himself. His love is free, everything we receive from Him is free. Why not make the most of the opportunity that is given to us. Why not make something beautiful out of our lives that we will always be proud of and others will be richer for our change. Above all, we must remember what the prophet Jeremiah told us in the first verse: ""The days will come when I will keep my promise! ""For God keeps His covenant: what He promises, He keeps. Perhaps we do not see this in our own lives because we have not yet allowed God to come in and put our lives in order. Perhaps we have relied too much on ourselves and our own abilities, and so we do not recognise the miracles that are happening today. Perhaps we have been so tempted by money that we have bet everything on this one ticket, and so we are constantly afraid and trembling about what will happen to our savings, which have been severely depleted by the recession. Yes, we need to get rid of this fear and build our confidence on new foundations that are not destroyed by the moth. So today we set out on the road to prepare for Christmas this year. May this holiday truly be a challenge to everyone to make this Christmas different. Christ came as our Saviour to be reborn, so that we might become new people. So now is the chance for each of us to make that happen. There is no exception. For me, too, this feast is a challenge, even though things may be clearer to me in theory. Theory is not life. That is why the preparation and the celebration itself must leave an impact on our emotional sphere, on our attitude to life and to everything that surrounds us. When this happens, we will indeed look at Christmas very differently. It is certainly true that Christmas is the most romantic of all the Church festivals, but it must also bring new content to our lives. Let us therefore enter boldly into the Advent season and use it for our personal renewal and the renewal of our parish community. <p/> Contact us <p/> Spiritual reflection",Opinion/Argumentation
"The Institute for Health Protection of the Republic of Slovenia (IVZ) and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Slovenia are participating in a large-scale European project entitled ""Transmission of patients' key health information for treatment abroad"" or epSOS (Smart Open Services for European Patients). The project aims to make key medical data available for the healthcare of citizens seeking medical assistance in another European country, while respecting the rights to the protection of personal data and privacy. <p/> As European citizens become increasingly mobile, travelling and working abroad more and more, they increasingly need medical assistance abroad. In order to provide quality medical treatment, the doctor abroad also needs the patient's vital health information. Modern information technology has long allowed authorised health professionals to access important health data collected in the patient's home country, based on the patient's consent. This is why many initiatives have been launched in Europe to create the right environment and conditions to make use of such technical possibilities for the benefit of better healthcare for European citizens. <p/> The epSOS project involves 47 partners from 20 European Union (EU) countries and three non-EU countries. The aim of the project is to carry out pilot projects to establish two cross-border services - the transmission of summary patient data and e-prescribing and e-medication. Therefore, the key tasks will be to organise the relevant legal bases in each participating country, to ensure an appropriate organisation of the work and to put in place the technical solutions. The initial phase of the project will test the feasibility and acceptability of the general-technical, organisational and legal coherence of the proposed solutions. The epSOS services, which include patient summaries and e-prescribing/e-dispensing, will be available on a trial basis in some countries already at the end of this year. <p/> Slovenia will test data exchange in 2012, probably first with Austria and Slovakia. <p/> For more information in English on epSOS, please visit the project website www.epsos.eu.",Information/Explanation
"Hotel Diana: Olga Belec wins in lawsuit between two female directors <p/> Court rejects Jasna Klepec's claim to annul the contract <p/> A ruling by the District Court in Murska Sobota has brought to an end a lawsuit in which Jasna Klepec, the owner of Hotel Diana, had sought to annul the contract by which she and her business partner Željko Jovanović bought a stake in the company from Olga Belec and her son Patrick Belec at the end of 2018. Luka Podjed, a Ljubljana-based lawyer who is defending Belč, says that the court expectedly rejected Klepč's claim and that it was, in his opinion, fundamentally unfounded. ""The court followed our arguments completely and found that there was no payment in cash. It also found that Klepčeva had obtained all the necessary information about the state of the company and the real estate, or had the opportunity to obtain it."" Klepčeva based her claim on allegations that Belčeva had not informed her of all the details of the company's business, including certain liabilities owed to employees, before signing the contract. The contract thus remains valid and, as previously reported, Hotel Diana has since ended up in bankruptcy. In addition to the annulment of the contract, Klepčeva's lawsuit also sought the reimbursement of the purchase price, claiming that it amounted to EUR 80 000 in total, although the contract, which was also notarised, stated an amount of EUR 30 000. <p/> Aleš Cipot <p/> Olga Belec <p/> Klepčeva claimed that, as agreed, on the day of the signing of the contract, 50 thousand euros were handed over to Belčeva in cash, allegedly by Matej Hofinger, a businessman from Velenje, who acted as an intermediary in the transaction, but they did not provide any evidence to convince the judge, Marjetica Škerget Logar, of their claims. Klepčeva says she is disappointed with the court's decision and will appeal it. Olga Belec welcomes the court's decision to the contrary, and believes that the allegations in the claim were fabricated. ""This proves what I have been saying all along, that the sale was transparent. I even went to help the new management for the first two months after the sale. I sold the company in good faith, because the buyers assured me that they would also buy the property, which I did not have enough money to do myself. So I was glad that someone who supposedly could save the company bought it, but if I had known that things would turn out this way, I would never have sold it to them."" As for the allegations of receiving cash, Belčeva reiterates that this never happened. She adds that she herself has thought a lot about how such allegations could have come about: ""I wonder whether Matej Hofinger might not have really received the money from Klepčeva, but gave it to someone else. In any case, the whole affair was about diverting attention to me, because I was State Secretary at the time, while the company was being financially drained.""",News

"Toronto Another Bust Abroad <p/> At this year's first edition of the Slovenian Music Week, representatives of prominent foreign festivals (Exit, Terraneo, Sziget, Vienna Waves) selected a few Slovenian artists to perform on individual foreign stages. In Odzven we have already introduced the band Dandelion Children, who performed at Exit in Serbia, with a short video-interview, and this time we asked some questions to the Toronto band Drug Bust, who will perform at Terraneo in Croatia on 7 August, and two days later at Sziget in Hungary.

Shortly after the launch, the latter two left the band and Košir was joined by Finnish musician Rami Helin. The current line-up consists of only Slovenian musicians, along with Košir, Vid Polončič Ruparčič (guitar), Nejc Kržič (bass), Tamir Gostiša (guitar) and Dorian Granda (drums).

"News archive <p/> Government issues decree on small-scale renewable energy installations. <p/> On 5 March, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia issued a Regulation on small-scale installations for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources or with high-efficiency cogeneration. The Regulation defines the types, size and conditions for the installation and connection of small-scale installations for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources or with high-efficiency cogeneration, which do not require a building permit in accordance with the regulations governing the construction of buildings. The Regulation is published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 14/2020. <p/> The Regulation is issued on the basis of the provisions of the Energy Act, which establishes the legal basis for the adoption of a by-law to determine the types of simple installations for the production of electricity from RES or CHP that do not require a building permit and are installed on, in or next to an existing building or civil engineering structure built in accordance with the regulations governing the construction of structures, their size and the conditions for their installation and connection. <p/> These subjects were previously regulated in the Energy Infrastructure Regulation, which also contained Chapter IV.a ""Specific features and exceptions in the field of electricity generation"", which provided that the installation of a RES/SPHPP electricity generation installation in accordance with the building regulations was to be considered as investment maintenance work (which did not require a building permit), provided that certain conditions were fulfilled. The new Energy Infrastructure Regulation, which entered into force in April 2016, repealed this Regulation and does not contain any provisions related to such production installations. This means that under the current legislation on the construction of buildings, the installation of such installations generally requires a building permit, which, given the relative complexity of their installation, constitutes an excessive administrative burden and has a disincentive effect on investment in such installations. Taking into account the fact that the Republic of Slovenia has to achieve binding targets for the production of electricity from RES (otherwise it faces high fines), investments in such installations should also be encouraged by removing administrative barriers. As will be explained below, the current building legislation allows for this, but this area also needs to be regulated in more detail in the energy regulations. Among other things, the Building Act stipulates that a building permit is not required for simple structures and maintenance of structures (Art. 5 of the Building Act). What falls into this category is derived from the Regulation on the classification of buildings, which lays down the criteria for classifying simple, non-complex, less complex, complex buildings, other building interventions and maintenance works. Maintenance work, according to point 4 (Installation of installations in, on and adjacent to the installation), includes, inter alia, the installation of new installations and associated installations for the exploitation of RES. However, as this has already been regulated in the abovementioned Energy Infrastructure Regulation, it is necessary to regulate the types of installations in the energy legislation, including power limitations, and the appropriate mechanisms to ensure the safety of the installation and the operation of such installations.

"When is it time to renovate the roof? <p/> The roof is a key structural element that protects the building from the elements (rain, snow, hail, sun, wind). The quality of the roof has a direct impact on the durability of the building and the living conditions inside, which is particularly important for living in a loft. <Once it no longer meets these requirements, it is time to renovate. But every leak does not mean that the whole roof has to be replaced.

However, if the roof is worn out or requires work such as modification of the roof structure to make extensions (to gain additional roof space) or to change the appearance of the roof for aesthetic reasons, reconstruction makes the most sense. <p/> How much will a roof renovation cost <p/> The price of a roof renovation depends primarily on the type of roofing material and its price. Prices for roofing material without installation start at: <p/> €7/m2 for concrete and bitumen roofing, <p/> €8/m2 for brick roofing, <p/> €10/m2 for metal roofing <p/> Installation costs €15-20/m2. If the roofing has to be replaced in its entirety, in addition to the price for the roofing and the installation, we have to take into account the additional works that affect the price of replacing the roofing: dismantling, removal to a landfill, the condition of the wooden structure, the other roof elements (flashings, gutters, vents, etc.). <p/> Example of a roof replacement price calculation <p/> For a 150m2 gable roof replacement (brick tiles), we will charge approximately €30/m2 for materials and installation, i.e. a total of €4500/m2. <p/> If the replacement also includes the installation of a vapour barrier, dismantling and removal of the old roofing material, this means an additional cost of at least €1000. <p/> Don't forget about the building permit <p/> Replacing the roof and roofing is maintenance work and therefore does not require a building permit, as long as it is a structural renovation that does not change the size and shape of the building.

"Today, thinking or the free public use of the mind is once again becoming a matter of survival. Delirium is at the core of the political mainstream. This is also reflected in the sentence uttered by the Finance Minister-designate at Monday's hearing: ""We find ourselves in an extremely challenging situation where, logically, we should be doing something, but we are forced to do the opposite."" Mramor's sentence thus suggests that the incoming government will take decisions that will go against logic, i.e. common sense, and therefore against what would be best for the majority of people. <p/> So the government will continue to follow the delirious path that is deepening the crisis, imposing policies as solutions that have long since been proven to be counterproductive and harmful. Therefore, as long as we allow those who have received their mandate from the people, in their self-confidence and harmful optimism, to continue to take decisions unhindered, not by following the logic of things, but by following its opposite (where the guiding principle becomes the service of this or that private interest to the detriment of the community), a way out of the crisis is neither probable nor possible. <p/> Today's problem is not at all a lack of optimism or even pessimism, as one might think if one were to accept uncritically the statements that people in the highest positions make in the public arena. What is much more problematic at this time is a particular kind of optimism, which is most often expressed by the very representatives of the political and economic elites. <p/> We could get an impression of such optimism listening to the outgoing Prime Minister in an interview on the national television channel. In particular, she praised the past achievements of her government, and then went on to talk, with a kind of barbecue, about how she is convinced that, in the end, we will find a solution to the problem that will arise when the route of the pipeline is decided again, where the interests of Russia and the EU are in conflict (and she herself will have to do a somersault in her future role as Commissioner, representing exactly the opposite position on this issue to the one she held as Prime Minister when she met the Russian gas tycoon), which will definitely make the future bright. <p/> Her completely uncritical rant, which was also without a hint of feeling for the difficult situation in which many families and individuals in this country find themselves, having to deal with questions about how to get through the month on a daily basis, is not an isolated case, though. Optimism has become quite commonplace in the speeches of politicians, although it is difficult to show that it actually accompanies action to improve the quality of life of citizens - it often appears precisely in the absence of any substance, or when someone in a position of responsibility is rightly expected to make a constructive proposal or take a very concrete step (because that is what they are elected to do), and yet, by waxing lyrical, they are hiding the fact that they have no idea of how to tackle the most acute problems. <p/> One of the most optimistic politicians here is certainly the President of the country himself. In a recent speech, he said this: ""If we are smart, brave and composed enough, we can now finally turn things around. Over time, people's living standards will rise again, our confidence in the country's legal and political institutions will be strengthened and an encouraging, optimistic mood will return."" What exactly is the basis for such optimism? What - apart from fine words - is there here to inspire credibility? What political solutions to one of the most serious problems, such as the growing poverty among the population and the immense enrichment of a minority, are promised in the actions of the incoming government? What reason for optimism should we have in view of the fact that the unemployment rate has not changed significantly and that there is no prospect of any beneficial changes any time soon (and with the statements of the future Finance Minister, there are perhaps even fewer reasons for such optimism)? <p/> On the side of those in power today, the trend is one of optimism and overconfidence, which could more accurately be described as pathological narcissism, where the rest of us are reduced in their eyes to a passive audience that is merely there to validate their inflated egos (the various fights for the post of Commissioner and the self-aggrandisement of who is better suited for it are a sign of this very phenomenon). <p/> It may seem to some that, since we still do not have a prescription for how to build a democratic society, it is best to leave things to those who have already ""screwed up"" many things in the past (just think how many members of parliament and even of the incoming government have formed past ""fallen"" governments, and have now been given a mandate again for the next few years), since they are at least old acquaintances on the political scene (and should therefore know how to go about the management of common affairs). <p/> Some change of mind is needed. Derrida's idea of democracy implies that democracy is a process that is also a learning process: democracy is the happening, the practising or learning of democracy. So the (democratic) communion has yet to be invented or inventing. An honest attitude is therefore not the flimsy optimism of a Pahor or Bratušek, but anything but. It requires a lot of thinking, intellectual work and experimentation, trying out the ways in which people organise their daily lives in community. And that means that it will only be possible when people try to live it, to put it into practice, to practise it, and therefore when they come to the debate without asking the authorities for permission. Democracy cannot be taught to the people, nor is it necessary. But a certain amount of self-reliance is certainly in order. It is probably true that any political engagement requires a great deal of thought, study and insight into many complex issues, but that does not mean that one should remain silent until someone gives the floor and allows one to speak up. Democracy cannot be some once-and-for-all status quo brought to the people by a good man like Santa Claus. This is why Derrida stressed that democracy is always its own promise, something that is always yet to come (if people work for it, of course). <p/>The biggest obstacle to democratisation and engagement is not ignorance at all, because Socrates already knew that it is in fact the privileged place of the production of all possible knowledge. The greatest obstacle to both the spiritual or mental progress of the individual and the progress of the community towards the common good is the arrogance that is everywhere today in the words of the most influential politicians and other members of the elite. Listening to politicians of the highest rank, from the President of the European Commission to prime ministers and economists of the international financial institutions, one gets the impression that they all know the solutions, we just have to let them implement them. (And then, when these people are actually given a free hand, more often than not, the opposite happens: problems are potentiated, because their ""solutions"" become the real problems - just remember t. (This is because such arrogance is akin to stupidity, which invariably has very concrete (and most often disastrous) effects on the people who are forced to live under its rule. This is also why it is necessary to shake off the prejudice that the ruling class always knows what it is doing. (All we can do, then, is to leave it alone in its self-delusion and join in the optimism it calls us to). This prejudice is also supported by the view that, in the circumstances, it is best to keep to oneself and mind one's own business, which then leaves the people on the political periphery as a more or less helpless bystander. <p/> The process of democracy therefore necessarily coincides with resistance to whatever makes it impossible (today, this is especially capitalism and its sadistic imperative to increase and centralise profits). Resistance is therefore logical, rational, in the name of logic. But without a critical attitude and a systematic use of doubt (especially when we are confronted with the statements and actions of agents of power), we cannot speak of democracy at all. <p/> Much more than simulated optimism, what we need is resistance in the name of logic, i.e. of mental action: this coincides here with an unshakable trust in the power of intelligence, i.e. in man's creative capacity and power to produce new ideas (such a trust has been contemplated by Enlightenment philosophers from Socrates and Plato to Spinoza and Descartes and Kant and Derrida...), which will, as an important part of the process of democracy, determine the shape of the world to come.",Opinion/Argumentation

"What is it, apart from the understaffing and the overburdening, which is also or mainly administrative, that has broken the bottom of the primary health care barrel? <p/> The 2019 General Agreement exacerbates an unsustainable situation <p/> The 2019 General Agreement sets a new (increased) ceiling for registrations in family medicine outpatient clinics, which are already bursting at the seams with no systemic solutions. And this is very bad news indeed. <p/> The General Agreement, whereby the health 'partners' each year redefine the financial pie for the provision of health services and programmes, does not really have a partnership character, because the strength of the professional arguments is repeatedly undermined by the arguments of power, which in the end seem to have a single denominator: politics, which has nothing to do with health care. Controversial issues are always decided by the government. <p/> The Association of Health Care Institutions has proposed an annex to the General Agreement ... <p/> That is why the Association of Health Institutions of Slovenia has proposed the adoption of annex number one to the general agreement for this year. With regard to the overload in family medicine clinics in primary health care, where doctors in some health centres are announcing the termination of their employment contracts because there is no other solution on the horizon, this association has proposed a solution quite comparable to the conclusions recently adopted by the annual conference of the Fides doctors' and dentists' trade union. The proposed annex thus, rather surprisingly, puts doctors, their unions and the management of health care institutions on the same side. <p/> The proposal was made by the Association in accordance with the agreement on the suspension of strike activities signed by the Fides union and the government - and already in force in the general agreement for the 2017 and 2018 contract years. According to this agreement, primary care doctors can refuse to identify new insured persons once they reach the national average of the headache ratios for each specialty, while family medicine doctors and paediatricians can refuse to identify new insured persons once they reach a headache ratio of 1895. <p/> The Association of Health Care Institutions drafted the annex in accordance with the agreement on the temporary suspension of strike action. <p/> ... the ZZZS Board of Directors rejected the proposal <p/> Doctors may decide to take such a step if the employer has not exhausted all the human resources and organisational possibilities that would allow the definition of insured persons - tenders for new recruitments, proposal of the need for new specialisations, subcontracting of doctors, including retired ones, redirection of insured persons of full age from a paediatrician to a family doctor ... <p/> However, at yesterday's meeting, the ZZZS Board of Directors rejected the proposal to urgently include this option in the general agreement for this year. We are now in a situation in Slovenian healthcare where there is virtually no room for manoeuvre - for the time being in family medicine, but similar stories are unfolding in other branches of medicine too. And since this serious, complex problem is being pointed out not only by doctors or nurses and their unions, but now even by the management of health care institutions, this is a sign that the existing system is not, and can no longer be, a guarantee for the sustainable, high-quality, professional, comprehensive and safe operation of health care - a sign to which we urgently need to react and take immediate action to remedy the situation that has arisen. <p/> The proposal to urgently include this option in the general agreement for this year was rejected by the ZZZS Board. <p/> The association is convinced that the agreement between the government and the Fides trade union, enshrined in the agreement on the suspension of strike activities, should be respected - and that if the timetable for reaching the target norm had to be changed in this sense, the signatories to the agreement would have to resume negotiations and redraft the agreement. So what next - apart from the announced activities of primary care doctors? <p/> ""We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted"" <p/> ""We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted"" <p/> ""We find it difficult to understand that the ZZZS Board is opposed to what has in fact already been agreed, signed and accepted. One is to continue with the annex procedure, but this kind of search for a solution is time-consuming and could drag on until the autumn. There is also another way. The new Minister for Health will have to deal with these problems as soon as he is appointed - and it is not impossible that the partners who are agreeing on the content of the general agreement will not be able to come up with a coherent, possibly even new, proposal to alleviate the acute situation we are witnessing at the moment. I can assure you that the association will be cooperative, because it wants to contribute to a reasonable solution - but if we find ourselves in a situation where emotions and other motives prevail, it will be difficult to find a solution,"" said Marjan Pintar, Director of the Association of Health Care Institutions, speaking to Health Portal. <p/> And what is your message to the new Minister of Health, Ales Šabedr? <p/> What do you expect from the new Health Minister Ales Šabedr?

"RECEPTION OF THE FIRE TRUCK GVM-1 <p/> On Saturday, 30 September 2017, the municipality of Sveti Jurij in Slovenske gorice was particularly festive, as we gathered at the invitation of the Voluntary Fire Brigade Sveti Jurij in Slovenske gorice for the ceremony of the reception of the new fire truck GVM-1. The ceremony was graced by the presence of the following guests: the Mayor of the Municipality of Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah Peter Škrlec, the Deputy President of the Lenart Firefighters' Association Robert Mesarec, the Commander of the Lenart Fire Brigade Leopold Omerzu, the Deputy Commander of the Lenart Fire Brigade Franc Lakner, the Sub-Commander of the Lenart Fire Brigade and the Commander of the Sveti Jurij v Slovih goricah Fire Brigade. Gorice Robert Kukovec, Commander of the Municipal Command of the Municipality of Pesnica Jože Repa, Commander of the Civil Protection of the Municipality of Sveti Jurij Alen Breznik, local parish priest and dean Janko Goergner, representatives of the volunteer fire brigades from Benedikt, Cerkvenjak, Lenart, Svete Trojice, Svete Anna, Voličina, Selce, Gočova and Oseko; from the neighbouring firefighters' association, the event was graced by the presence of representatives of the Volunteer Fire Brigades from Jakobsko Dolo, Jarenina, Šentilj and Velka. <p/> The celebrations were introduced by a festive parade. At the beginning of the parade, we watched the bearer of the national flag, Alojz Žnofl, a junior firefighter of the 2nd level, followed by the firefighter's emblem carried by the juniors of PGD Sveti Jurij, Maja Kukovec and Nuša Najdenik. The parade was then led by. The parade commander was Robert Kukovec, firefighter newspaperman II, vice-commander of the Lenart Firefighters' Association and commander of the Sveti Jurij Fire Brigade, and his assistants were Uroš Črnčec, junior firefighter newspaperman I and Tilen Kristl, senior firefighter I. <p/> This was followed by the Lenart Fire Brigades Association's Platoon of Honour, which is made up of members from all ten Lenart Fire Brigades Association companies. It was led by Jernej Sinič, Senior Firefighter, and Ivan Divjak was the flag bearer of the Honor Platoon. <p/> The flag echelon followed. The standard bearers' echelon was led by Robert Črnčec, Firefighter's Timekeeper 1st Class, Deputy Commander of the home association. The flag bearer of the home association, Jožek Zaletinger, was at the head, with the youth flag of PGD Sveti Jurij, carried by Karin Najdenik, at his side. This was followed by banner bearers from all ten Lenart Fire Brigade associations and banner bearers from the neighbouring associations of Jakobsko Dolo, Jarenina, Šentilj and Velka. This was followed by the firefighter youth echelon, commanded by Alen Breznik, senior firefighter. Next came the members' echelon, led by Dejan Najdenik, a junior firefighter, 1st level. <p/> This was followed by the echelon of fire engines. At the head was a 1982 FAP vehicle driven by Jože Sinič. This was followed by the AC16/40 special vehicle, driven by Branko Črnčec. Next was the newer Mercedes Atego GVC 16/25, driven by Žan Krajnc. Other vehicles of the Lenart Fire Brigades Association and neighbouring volunteer associations followed. <p/> After the parade, all firefighters and guests gathered for the main ceremony in the tent in front of the entrance to Jura Square. <Before the start of the ceremony, the commander of the Sveti Jurij Fire Brigade, Robert Kukovec, asked the Mayor of the municipality, Peter Škrlec, for permission to start the event. <p/> In the introduction of the ceremony, the President of the Sveti Jurij Volunteer Fire Brigade in Slovenske gorice, Gregor Nudl, spoke about the activities that led to the new fire truck being among us, about the wishes for a new vehicle. As the acquisition of a new fire truck is a great financial burden, but also a joy and pride for the firefighters and all citizens, the Mayor of Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah, Peter Škrlec, also spoke on the occasion of such an important acquisition for our town and praised the efforts of the Jurij firefighters for the modernisation of the fleet and the dedicated performance of volunteer firefighting activities. Of course, all the assembled firefighters and guests were also welcomed by the Deputy President of the Lenart Firefighters' Association, Robert Mesarec. <p/> This was followed by the official handover of the vehicle, during which the President and the Commander of the Sveti Jurij PGD handed over the keys to the driver and the vehicle's custodian, Andrej Sinič. The new firefighting vehicle was blessed by the local parish priest and dean, Janko Gögner, who wished the users of the vehicle a happy and safe journey and to use it mainly for social purposes and as little as possible for interventions. <p/> The ceremony of taking over the new vehicle was enriched with a short cultural programme by the Jurova Octet and the young accordionist Marko Igrec. <p/> As the purchase of a new firefighting vehicle is unimaginable without financial support, the representatives of the Voluntary Firefighters' Association Sveti Jurij v Slovenskih goricah presented a token of appreciation to all donors and godparents who financially supported the Association in the purchase of the new firefighting vehicle. <p/> We concluded the ceremony with a sincere wish for the Jurij firefighters that despite the new equipment, volunteerism, courage and helping their fellow man remain their values. <p/> After the ceremony, there was a social gathering of all the firemen and firewomen, followed by the entertainment part of the celebration, as our firefighters also provided the appropriate catering, and we were able to warm up our hands and heels to the music of the ensemble Hearty Musicians.",News

"Proposal for a Spatial Development Strategy (SPR) for the Municipality of Radovljica <p/> J.U.: On the margins of the public debate held on Wednesday, 10 January 2007 from 6 to 8 p.m. <p/> All municipalities in Slovenia are in the middle of a planning process. By July 2007, they should have brought their respective spatial planning acts, which are extremely complex in terms of procedure, into line with the new legislation. Since only a few municipalities are further along than ours (we are in the middle of the beginning), is it to be expected that either the deadline will be extended, or the government will just manage to do as much as it can, and finally, for once, reward those who can do it by the deadline, and the rest ...? <p/> Undoubtedly, these processes are and will be the first serious planning in more than 20 years, in other words: it is an extremely challenging undertaking for the administration, the general and interested public and the planning profession. Since 1980 (self-management), we have been ""tinkering"" with the spatial and environmental planning system on the basis of the non-market economy, which - surprisingly - has been quite good in some parts. <p/> As far as our municipality is concerned: need it be pointed out that the administration's management has approached the matter left-handed in terms of substance and procedure? It simply does not have the expertise in cases of major dilemmas! <p/> Yes, that's the way it is when bureaucrats ignore the rajas! All the indications are that this planning will receive the same treatment as the dog excrement ordinance, which is of course not news in Radovljica. Last night, the Director, in a low-key rhetoric, respectfully stressed the importance of the process and the document, but only actions count. <p/> Let us stress: <p/> everything in the municipality revolves around space. Other departments are also important, but not as fatal as encroachments. The only complete department of the municipal administration, staffed by professional, educated and administratively proficient employees, looks as if they have been successfully weaned off professionalism and accustomed to subservience to politicians, like the MOL, ""when everyone is busting their ass"". This is due to a misguided governmental logic (we are in charge now, if something is not right, we will show that this is the only possible and even the only right thing to do, that is why we have PR) and a touch of servility, only the first silence and eaten professionalism will suffice... <p/> The materials under discussion do not testify to the care of a good steward for the emerging creature, in fact, it could even be argued that something (the ALCs) was explicitly not allowed to be included in it. <p/> Even the operational meetings of the administration with the spatial planning authorities (e.g. KS, sectoral, e.g. agriculture, housing, etc.) could have yielded more if they had been properly conceived and committed to. To be clear: the administration is the planning authority, and the documents are drawn up together with a specially paid team. And if something is left out or selectively drafted, we - with their superficial ""reading"" of our space - are the ones in trouble. If such a document is commissioned and its content dictated by politics, then we are far from a profession (Al Gore, An Inconvenient Truth ... ), nothing changes (except for the worse). <p/> What is also missing are proposals from those responsible officials (aren't we making too many synecdoches? ! ) who, in their official capacity, are the first to be responsible for making proposals (obligations of laws, decrees, contracts: local infrastructure, culture, education, etc.). <p/> The situation does not show the slightest concern for the mayor (excused absence abroad, where are the two vice-mayors? ) or for the director of the administration, who should have a project manager, and above all, be trusted to do so. The process thus has no profiled promoter ('municipality', mayor, director, head of department, chairman of the spatial planning committee? ! ) and does not even receive the necessary publicity. If you sell, advertise! There is no campaign, logo or sign that something fatal is in the pipeline to involve as many people as possible in the processes, and consequently a greater involvement of the disciplines. The time around the New Year is, of course, not the right time for unveilings. The administration is merely covering legal formalities, not the substantive reasons for extending the festive blackout. <p/> What stands out from such superficial processes is the ""redundancy"" of planning in the light of the parallel ad hoc actions promoted (elections), and the ""pro forma"" content of the ""development coalition"", the voting machine of the only good thinker who will lead us to paradise anyway, is a little annoying in the new mandate. <p/> Not to mention the occasional carping about the adopted and approved development platforms 2007 - 2013 (we are going to the region for EU money ... ), which are not yet recognised as typical political documents for daily use. <p/> We can be quite calmly critical, because the product under discussion (the decree) speaks of the politicisation of purely professional tasks. The formal inclusion of the CFs (do we have them for that?) and the exclusion of the 11 ""development opposition"" councillors of the municipal council is living proof of paper democracy, or of the scenario of how ""Janko"" (who is the ""broomstick"" here? ) imagines a wonderland where we will all be living like in paradise.... <p/> Everything points to the fact that the understanding of the preparation of the emerging document is reduced to an administrative minimum, everything that exists today without propaganda, if it really is not indispensable, practically does not exist. <p/> (J.U.: more information on the contents will be presented periodically, the public debate is open until 15 January 2007, more information on the decree and the background is on the CoR website). <p/> The public debate, the proceedings and the controversial contents are reported by the main municipal media (website) amongst ""other things"" with only a cursory information on the hearing, the documents are attached. That this is not enough is shown by all the poorly attended hearings, but nothing by the administration! <p/> We will wait with interest to see what the Provincial News has to say about the procedures and processes. It is not worth pointing out that the administration has not taken care - apart from the filming, to which we have been warned a couple of times by the Director of the administration - of the ""public relations"" which otherwise covers the Mayor's every step (ec). Or is it? <p/> HERE'S an excerpt from last night's debate, to prove how recently ago some people took the now fatal spatial interventions lightly and politicised them, and how ""everything"" is politics (only how will they justify them tomorrow? ): <p/> ""... Radovljica's landscape will be by far the most damaged by the semi-tubed AC of all the interventions. The unnatural embankments on both sides take away from the plain what is most valuable and distinctive, or add something alien to it ..."" / Statement by a representative of the KR Institute for the Protection of Natural and Cultural Heritage, ... who also informed us that we have insufficiently illuminated pedestrian crossings ...?/. <p/> (J.U.: Madam, just where was she during the mayor's ""semi-digging"" into the AC problems? <p/> Another, this time verbal, proof: <p/> Semi-deepening is of course not ""deepening"" and more than obviously nothing good, useful can be born out of ""semi-(itic) deepening"". <p/> We have evidence, look out of the car window when you drive down the main road ...).",Opinion/Argumentation

"Still a storm in no man's land <p/> Monday, 10 October, marked the ninety-first year since the Carinthians chose their country in a plebiscite. In the choice between the foreign Austria they knew and the native, Slavic Kingdom of SHS they did not, the former prevailed. Although they had won a country, their homeland was increasingly under threat. The struggle of the Carinthian partisans for their mother tongue, forests and justice has recently been the subject of two recent works by Maja Haderlap and Peter Handke. <p/> The Angel of Forgetting (Engel des Vergessens), a novel by Haderlap, was awarded one of the most important prizes in the German-speaking world, the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize, and Handke's work Still the Storm (Immer noch Sturm), which was awarded the Austrian Nestroy Theatre Prize for the best play of 2011, had its premiere at the Burgtheater in Vienna at the beginning of October, following its premiere at the Salzburg Gala Games and its premiere at the Thalia Theatre in Hamburg. Between autobiography and historical testimony, Maja Haderlap's novelistic debut tells the story of her ancestors from Lepen near Železná kapla, centring on her grandmother, who survived the torture of the Ravensbrück women's concentration camp (""She saved herself, yes, but if that is why she prefers to live, she doesn't know. ""), and his father, who fled to the partisans at the age of 12 after the Nazi torture that marked his life forever (""I would rather forget everything. ""). The first-person narrator, me, changes as the narrative unfolds from a girl who is still learning basic concepts, like, for example, the partisans, to a woman torn between her home environment and the world, Slovenian and German, the stage and reality and, most importantly, the past and the present. The story thus grows from simple descriptions of the domestic environment, family relationships and children's ideas of the world into a document of time, filled with a historico-political charge, which testifies to the relations between the Slovenian minority and the Austrian majority, to the forgotten, ignored and scorned partisan resistance, and to the shadows that the past casts over the divided Carinthian families of the present. That I always, regardless of age, tells its story in the present tense, in some places causing blurred transitions between the past and the present, but at the same time emphasising being trapped in time and showing how far into the past we have to reach in order to shed light on the present. The Constant Self also drifts into an overly direct autobiography on a few occasions, which, while intimately convincing the reader that the story being told is true, also strips away a bit of objectivity from the overall historical testimony. Otherwise, The Angel of Forgetting goes beyond testimony, and in some places even turns into poetry, a language of powerful images that is the antipode to the simple, clear and pure narrative tone. <p/> The Snows of History Still Storming, arguably Handke's most personal work to date, was to have been put on the stage of Vienna's Burgtheater as a guest performance by Handke's friend Claus Peymann, but a falling out broke out between the director and the playwright, and they broke off their collaboration. Handke then decided to publish the play as a book (by the German publishing house Suhrkamp) and left the direction to the Bulgarian-born director Dimitri Gotscheff (whose production of Aeschylus' The Persians was seen as a guest performance at Cankarjev dom in 2010) for the Salzburg Festival Games. Handke entrusted the Bulgarian director with an understanding of the Slavic soul and the tragedy of losing one's homeland, but he also wanted the director not to leave out much of the text and thus create a multi-hour play comparable to Über die Dörfer (Across the Village), directed by Wim Wenders for the Salzburg Festival in 1982. Gotscheff succeeded in putting on stage one of Handke's most powerful texts, which the author himself called a jaloig about the Carinthian revolt and the history of my family. The text, in which there are no clearly identified persons and their replicas, but also no didascalia, resembles a novel in dialogue rather than a dramatic work, moving between languages (choral German, Carinthian dialect and Slovene) and genres (lyric, epic, drama). The central narrator and observer is himself (an excellent performance by Jens Harzer), surrounded by his (dead) ancestors in the Carinthian foothills of Austria: his grandparents, his mother and her three brothers (Gregor, Valentin, Benjamin) and his sister (Ursula). Jaz's perspective resembles the view from the cradle of an elderly (blue) baby, asking, reporting and commenting, but sometimes it seems as if he is not there at all, or as if the whole action is taking place in his half-sleep. That it is just a nightmare that he doesn't know whether it is happening inside him or outside him, whether he is crawling inside it or being attacked by it (""Not that I leave you alone. Don't leave me alone, be still. You do not leave me alone, no and no. ""). I follows a family tragedy: the deaths of the (forcibly conscripted) Wehrmacht soldiers Benjamin and Valentin, and then the death of the (at first delighted and then disappointed) partisan Ursula (with the partisan name Snežena). The only son who returns to the family is Handke's uncle, the partisan Gregor. Gregor, whom Handke portrayed (though always differently) in several of his works, studied fruit-growing in Maribor and wrote a book on apple varieties, which the family on stage reads as a Bible (in Slovenian), but the product of his uncle Gregor, who was actually killed as a soldier in the Wehrmacht, is also supposed to have a special place in Handke's real life. The stage is completely empty and bare, the costumes do not change, there are hardly any props. There is a void, filled with words of rage and frustration, sadness and suffering. Words about the language the family wanted to save (""To save a language is to save a soul. ""), about the homeland it wanted to preserve (""To lose the homeland once, to lose the homeland forever. ""), and about the history it wanted to write (""History, it has swallowed up my life and our life, the feeling of life. ""). During the four-hour-long speech, green confetti keeps falling on the stage, fast or slow. History snows, slowly covering space, time and performers. <p/> Home, Church, Politics, History, Language and Self Maja Haderlap and Peter Handke build their texts in different narrative tones: she calmly and occasionally confessional, he wildly and preachily. She is drawn to sentiment and he to irony, we sense in her the fusion of words and landscape and in him their incompatibility. But the motifs that merge into the narrative flow remain the same. The house as the point of contact and the most important space for the whole family. Politics, which those who have been most deeply disappointed avoid in the greatest arc. A dream in which the past and the present are intertwined. A Church that has thrown away its own children because they have taken up the fight for the language in which its priests preached before the war. And last but not least, there is the point of contact with me, a person who was born too late to live, yet will never escape. Both writers feel the pain of politics devouring history and history devouring their own children (""They know that their past does not appear in Austrian history books, still less in those of Carinthia, where the history of the country begins with the end of the First World War, pauses and continues with the end of the Second World War. ""The Austrian post-war statehood was founded (among other things) on the resistance of the Carinthian Slovenians, on the blood sacrifice in the local forests and orchards, and then was sucked into the black hole of history. (""A country that does not want us, and it is because of us that it is allowed to exist as a state..."") One of the strongest motifs of both narrators is language - in Handke's case, it is the fear of its loss that is stronger, and the hope for its salvation or at least its recognition (""Our language, our strength. Beyond language, violence erupts. "", ""Language, mine, ours: the hen's ladder will be Jacob's ladder.""), while in Haderlap's case it is a more intimate search for one's own identity (""I hope that later I will find or invent the right language... "", ""Who am I, who do I belong to, why do I write Slovenian and speak German? ""The two narratives, which take place on the periphery of our territory, are not just a matter of province. Just as much as they are a matter for Austria because of its suppressed history, they are also a matter for central Slovenia, which most often does not hear the voices from the periphery. At the Burgtheater in Vienna, a section of the audience gave the production of Still the Storm a standing ovation, and there were shouts of enthusiasm from the boxes. Many audiences attend Maya Haderlap's many Austrian readings. When will the subtle stories from the periphery touch all Slovenian viewers and readers, and when will we begin to see their past as our own? The Slovenian translation of Handke's text (published by Wieser, translated by Brane Čop, reviewed by Florjan Lipuš and Peter Handke) will be available in the second half of November, while Maja Haderlap's novel will be published in Slovenian next summer (by Litera). <p/>Quotes",Review

"Publishing <p/> DI Kranjska Gora: Visiting elderly and sick members <p/> Chatting. <p/> In addition to these two names, the month of December, or December, has a championship in popular naming. To name but a few: Happy December, the craziest month, the month with the most lonely people, the month with the most holidays, the month with the millions of cards said, the month with the most goodies on the plates, the month with the craziest spending, the month of taking out loans for a few hours of crazy eating, the month of merchants, the month of children's joys, the month of mass temporary resettlement, the month of crazy behaviour, and I could go on and on. <p/> The purpose of my writing, however, is to shed some light on the designation, 'the month with the loneliest'. Why shine a light on something that is always more hidden than revealed? All our disabled people's associations are experiencing more and more members from the third age group. I am not saying that there is no loneliness in the younger groups of people, but it is clear that it is in the group of people in the third stage of life that there is the greatest loneliness. This is the generation that has already finished its working and creative task in life, has gone into the solitude of its retirement. <p/> The fallacy that everyone can hardly wait to retire is only true until you are about to leave your job for good and realise it. You have to leave the comrades who have kept you company for days and years, for better or for worse. The daily commute to work turns into looking out of the window and thinking how my comrades at work are doing. I count myself among the group that it took me two years to accept that I was no longer needed, that I was a tool that had outlived its usefulness. Even though I still had many social tasks and a lot of movement between people, it did not fill me up, so that I did not feel lonely and marginalised. Although I moved among the crowds, I always felt alone. I am not saying that this pattern applies to all of us who have retired, but I know that some of us felt marginalised, exploited in the workplace, and I know that they found it difficult to wait for the arrival of the last day at work. <p/> But this retirement has pushed the vast majority of people into isolation, at least temporarily, until they have found a job in some other area of society, and what if they have not? Usually these are the years when grandchildren come into the world, who somehow fill in society from work, but only temporarily. <p/> Filling time, which is too much at one time, can also lead to an incredible new burden of overwork and lack of time for oneself. This feeling leads to a new isolation, which makes one think that everyone has forgotten one's self and that one is just a tool of one's family or surroundings for as long as one is needed, and then one should get out from under one's feet for once. When, for many, there is the worm that sees that we are only waiting for our miserable end, loneliness reaches a peak that usually leads to a state of illness of mind and body, which is devastating for the individual. <p/> I myself am fortunate in that I am somehow still active in several areas, but it is also true that I always give myself just the right amount of time to myself so that I do not feel marginalised and lonely. But many times the thought creeps into my mind, yes, one day you will have to admit enough is enough, yes it is true, but I am pushing that thought into the future, when it will be, so why bother with it today. <p/> I am also fortunate to run a disabled people's association which employs me. Sometimes the work goes beyond what is reasonable, but that is only sometimes and when the state bureaucracy overreaches itself with tasks that benefit no one and we, through the associations, have to fulfil them. Running a society gives me the opportunity to chat with the membership more and more, which is like the salt of life. Chatting is usually a part or a courtesy of life when meeting people. If the main aim of chatting is to have a positive effect on the relationship and well-being of two or more people together, then I can say that chatting has an impact on the quality of the relationships between the membership. Chatting is typically a game of words. The basic rule of chatting is to strengthen mutual relations with elements of joking, fun, courtesy and to spend time together to avoid excruciating silence and to exchange different opinions on certain problems or events. Chatting has the aim of being friendly to other people and to the surroundings trapped in the same space. <p/> While chatting with the membership, I discover the phenomenon of loneliness of each member. Loneliness can be equated with talent, both components need to be discovered, neither is visible on its own. During December, this phenomenon is even more pronounced and killing. December is a month of anticipation, a month of planning a new path, a month of reckoning with the past tense, but also with the thought, everyone is going to have fun and rejoice, and it will be just me or myself for the holidays and the rejoicing. <p/> This thought leads many into a negative black mentality and even leads the slightly more unstable personalities into the thought of ending a sad life. In the Association we are aware of this situation of some of our members and we are working to raise awareness among the membership that loneliness and exclusion are most often caused by personal reflections and certainly not by social exclusion. <p/> In this month, which has only just begun, the Association of People with Disabilities of the municipality of Kranjska Gora has for years had a campaign to visit individual members who have been passive and more or less inactive over the year. The reason for the visit is usually justified by a small token of appreciation with a few sweets and a souvenir suitable for the December time. All this is cause for a short chat and a chat. <p/> Believe me, such a visit and a gift is the key that not only opens the front door of the home, it is also the key to the heart of the person being visited. A chat usually gives many answers which we had only suspected before. Whatever time our volunteers spend on such a visit, it always turns out in the end to have been too short and too measured. Usually, such a visit turns into indescribable happiness and joy, with the visitor realising that ""I am not forgotten by everyone yet"". I also take part in such visits as much as time permits and it fills me with a certain missing energy that I miss before such a visit, even though I am not even aware that I am missing it. <p/> The people who are visited are also aware of a certain helplessness and loneliness, but they do not know how to help themselves and get out of this cycle of loneliness. This is where our task as the leadership of the association comes in, to find the lonely members and help them to pierce the veil that keeps them in a certain vacuum of loneliness. This is what the mandatory seventh social programme, Preventing and alleviating the social and psychological consequences of disability, requires us to do. <p/> I dare say that we are an association with a good diversification of social work, but all the same we are left with a passive membership that cannot be animated into active membership. How to reach such a member and how to stimulate them is a Gordian knot whose shell we have not even raised, let alone broken. I am also aware that it will never be possible to raise everyone to the level of a working member. I am convinced, however, that we need to do more on this problem of inactivity and the results will come. Let me end my reflections with a greeting that is appropriate in these times, and I wish everyone good luck.",Opinion/Argumentation
"Mole <p/> Mole <p/> The common or European mole (scientific name Talpa europaea) is a species of insectivore adapted to life underground. It rarely comes to the surface except during dry periods when it goes in search of water. Signs of its presence are moles. <p/> Mole shrews are active both during the day and at night, constantly searching for food. They dig tunnels at different depths. If the tunnel is just below the surface, it starts to throw soil to the surface, creating a mole. The tunnels can be 30 to 50 metres long. When looking for food, it runs through the tunnels for four hours and then rests for the same amount of time. Although the tunnels of different moles may be intertwined, they avoid each other, especially outside mating season. If they do meet, a fierce fight ensues, which can lead to death. Scientists hypothesise that moles also mark their territory by scent-marking the ground from the musk glands located on their abdomens. It is only during mating season that the male seeks out the female. After mating, the male leaves the female to care for the young. <p/> It feeds mainly on earthworms, although it will not give up insects and snails. The mole needs a lot of food and eats half its own weight daily. The greyhound does not have a well-developed sense of hearing and smell, but can still detect food and water at long distances. Because it lives underground in the dark, it does not need good eyesight. However, it has a well-developed sense of smell and can detect very faint vibrations. Its muzzle is covered with hairs, which help it to find prey. The mole has more sense organs than any mammal. We know very little about its sense organs. Because they cause damage to meadows and fields, farmers often kill them. <p/> The mating season of moles is very short. The male seeks out the female underground, where they mate. The male then leaves the female and is no longer interested in the fetus. Gestation lasts for one month. Three or four young are born between May and July in a nest for which the female has built a special room. They are naked when they are born, but after 24 days they have grown fur. They can leave the nest after 35 days to find their own territory. <p/> Protection <p/> In Slovenia, moles are protected and deterrents are used to combat them. We have developed an extremely effective and natural deterrent, Celaflor Mole Repellent, in the form of beads with the active ingredient methylnonylon ketone. It is completely harmless to humans and animals. It is important to follow the instructions on the product and to allow the mole to escape from your garden (do not fence the garden on all sides with beads).",Information/Explanation
"End of Leg 4 of the Volvo Ocean Race <p/> Wednesday 04 Mar 2015 <p/> All six teams have successfully sailed into Auckland, New Zealand. Leg 4 was very interesting. Tactical decisions decided the final placings. Two were crucial. <p/> The importance of the right or wrong tactical decisions had the strongest impact on Team Brunel's final position. They sailed the first part of the leg from Sanya, China very well. Before the Philippines, they decided to sail north, where the winds were expected to be stronger. The tactical decision was the right one and they swung into first place, sailing all the way to the equator. Brunel's skipper, Bouwe Bekking, said after arriving at the finish: ""It's hard for a team that has sailed very well. We only finished in fifth place because of a mistake Andrew Cap and I made. The mistake we made cost us a good place. We were leading all the way to the equator. When we sailed with the wind to the east, things did not go as planned. The weather did not do what we expected. From the first place we had held since 15.2. we dropped to fifth on 22.2. And now we are at the finish line. For the second time in a row in fifth place. I must admit that I am disappointed. In the last few legs we have realised that very strange things can happen in a regatta. The differences between the teams are very small and many things can happen. That is the advantage of sailing on the same boats. It's just part of sailing!"" <p/> MAPFRE was the fastest team to finish Leg 4. The Abu Dhabi team followed and the Chinese boat Dongfeng came third. Team Alvimedica came in fourth ahead of Team Brunel, and the last to cross the finish line was the SCA women's crew.

This applies to the minority of lectures in English! Unfortunately, I do not know if they said anything more specific in the Spanish-speaking lecture theatres. <p/> Gustav Martner during his lecture <p/> Let's have a slide to rest your eyes, and I'll rest my fingers: <p/> Why don't sales people like this? - Because technology is democratising (it's available to most people) - Because digital distribution is democratising (it's available to most people) - Because anyone can be an agent (an ambassador for a product) - Because dialogue and conversation are being mass-produced - Because control is increasingly being lost <p/> The creativity of the advertising product, the culture it creates, is no longer as controllable as it used to be. <p/> Does this mean that traditional media such as TV, radio or print, as well as conventional online advertising, have a competitive opponent? Does it mean that there is an end to the traditional advertisements that are collected from a few people and that are advertised with the brute force of online or offline marketing? For such campaigns, we have to pay a lot of money, we call it 'bought media' - because we have paid to have a new product flogged to us on the web! <p/> Gustav Martner says NO! NOT AT ALL! <p/> He proved it with the example of Burger King T-shirts, just look at the Gustav Martner - OMExpo Madrid slides. If it is good advertizing, it is quickly used by the onlinecommunity and the issue goes viral! Which is genius! Two things are the only things that matter! <p/> The first is that there is no such control over what goes viral.

"The EPAR (European Public Assessment Report) lists VAED as an important potential risk to be monitored and reported. Neither is implemented in Slovenia, because doctors were not informed about it during the training sessions (and afterwards). <p/> VAED (Vaccine associated enhancement of disease) has been a major obstacle in the development of SARS and MERS coronavirus vaccines, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) vaccine and some other vaccines against infectious agents. <p/> It is an immunological phenomenon, mediated by antibodies or immune cells, which causes a vaccinated person to become ill, often more severely than an unvaccinated person, after coming into contact with a wild virus. <p/> This phenomenon has caused illness and death in laboratory animals in the past. In the late 1970s, the RSV vaccine caused severe illness and even death in vaccinated children. <p/> This immunological phenomenon has not been sufficiently investigated by Pfizer-BioNTech because: <p/> a) it did not use the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus in preclinical animal studies, but a surrogate virus - with the explanation that it does not have BSL3 (Biosafety Level 3) (EPAR, page 43). The EMA-e reviewer wrote in his report that the use of a surrogate instead of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus (in vaccine research) was not even discussed (!!!!). Also, for technical reasons (!!!), the manufacturer did not specify the ratio of neutralising to non-neutralising antibodies - which was also recommended in March 2020 by scientists gathered under the auspices of CEPI, explaining that it is an important 'indicator' of the possibility of VAED in vaccinated people. <p/> b) Phase 2/3 clinical testing was mainly conducted at a time when there was little or no presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the natural environment (the registration study for the provisional authorisation included data from May to the first half of October 2020); therefore, the majority of vaccinated people could not have come into contact with SARS-CoV-2, which would have been the only way to test for the possibility of developing VAED in them. The problem of testing the vaccine in the absence of the virus in the natural environment has also been pointed out by scientists in the summer of 2020 <p/> c) From a professional and scientific point of view, given the known problems of the history of coronavirus vaccines, it is therefore only appropriate to include in the registration study (on the basis of which the vaccine received provisional marketing authorisation) data also from the period of increased presence of the virus in the natural environment, i.e. late autumn and winter 2020/2021, when coronavirus infections started to occur again and vaccinees had the opportunity to come into contact with authentic (wild) SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. However, as noted above, the registration study did not capture this data, but mass vaccination of populations around the world had already begun during the period of re-emergence of the virus. <p/> The EPAR lists VAED as a significant potential risk (page 115). It is stated that the possible occurrence of this complication will continue to be monitored even after the provisional marketing authorisation has been granted. <p/> The Pharmacovigilance (Product Side Effects) Plan states that side effects of vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTecha Comirnaty will be tracked through a specific questionnaire, which will also include verification of vaccine ineffectiveness or the occurrence of VAED (page 116). In the section on additional pharmacovigilance activities (page 118, table, study C4591001), it is stated that the occurrence of an imbalance between the vaccinated and the control (unvaccinated) group in the number of cases, especially for the more severe form of the disease, kovid 19, could suggest VAED. The possibility of VAED should be monitored for 2 years after the second dose of vaccine, the EPAR states. <p/>The fact that this is an important immunological phenomenon that may have a detrimental effect on the health of vaccinees is also evident from the peer-reviewed literature. <p/> In March 2020, a group of experts in the field of vaccine and coronavirus immunology gathered under the auspices of CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation), also funded by capital and philanthropy, to examine the situation and the opportunities and obstacles to the development of a safe vaccine for coronavirus 19 disease. The problem in developing a vaccine against the 19 metalloid disease was highlighted as the possibility of VAED, in which the vaccine causes a more severe form of the disease if the vaccinated person subsequently becomes infected with a wild virus. They wrote that VAED was first observed in the 1960s in association with an inactivated RSV vaccine. Participants at the meeting recalled a case where the RSV vaccine did not prevent infection and 80% of vaccinated children became so severely ill after contact with wild virus that they required hospital treatment; 2 out of 35 children even died. <p/>It was noted that similar pathology has been described in SARS CoV-1 vaccine candidates (the causative agent of the 2002/2003 SARS pandemic) and that there is concern that similar pathology (particularly in terms of Th2 immunopathology) could occur in humans vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of kovid-19 disease). The possibility of ADE (antibody disease enhancement), another immunological mechanism directly induced by non-neutralising or sub-neutralising antibodies that allow a more efficient entry of the virus into the cells, has also been raised. <p/>They wrote that their findings should guide vaccine manufacturers in the development and testing of vaccine candidates, with the intention of avoiding the risks to humans from the use of vaccines against Covid-19. They also provided very specific guidance on the proper conduct of pre-clinical and clinical studies and validation of the development of VAEDs. <p/> In April 2020, scientists also discussed and warned in peer-reviewed journals about the possible occurrence of VAED after the use of the vaccine against the disease Kovid-19. They discussed the possibility of disease promotion by both humoral (antibodies - ADE) and cell-mediated (Th2 immunopathology) immunity mechanisms. Prof. Baric, an epidemiologist and expert on coronavirus, thought at the time that Th2 immunopathology would be a bigger problem, as animal models had shown that it was mainly older animals that were at risk; he expressed concern about what this might mean if the vaccine were used in older humans. <p/>We now know that the polio vaccine was first used in the elderly population; and the manufacturer's EPAR shows that the registration study included only 5 people aged 85+ among just over 18,000 vaccinees, and 804 people aged 75+, representing 4.4% of the total vaccinated (page 76, table). Some other scientists were also of the opinion that ADE pathology should not be a major problem and that the reports from China concerning re-infected people were also not suggestive of an ADE problem. <p/> Dr Graham, Executive Director of the Vaccine Development Centre at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), also mentioned the possibility of Th2 immunopathology in particular, and was supported by Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher who has worked, among other things, on the development of a SARS-CoV-1 vaccine. Dr Graham expressed concern about Th2 immunopathology, stating that an inappropriate T cell response would stimulate allergy-mediated inflammation and lead to the generation of poorly functional antibodies with consequent formation of immune complexes, leading to complement activation and the damage that could result. <p/> Dr Hotez pointed to the possibility of producing a vaccine on only part of the viral S-protein, i.e. the part that binds to the cellular receptor binding domain (RBD), which could possibly reduce the adverse immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech EPAR shows that the manufacturer also tested the vaccine candidate for the RBD component of the S-protein, which was later abandoned (page 58). Dr Graham, who worked with Moderna on vaccine development, said in April 2020: 'We need to get some answers by next winter to at least be better prepared for the winter of 2021-2022'. Well, the 'vaccine', including Moderna's, had already started to be used en masse 1 year earlier, much earlier than Dr Graham expected to 'get some answers'. <p/> Prof Perlman, an immunologist and microbiologist, said that a special commission had been set up at the WHO to look into the VAED issue. He expected that the commission would be able to report in a few months' time. In April 2020, the WHO and other health experts also stressed that it would take at least a year and a half before the vaccine would be thoroughly tested in both animal models and humans, and only then might it be put into wider, commercial use. In reality, things have been accelerated; within a year of his statement, some 3 billion people have been vaccinated with a poorly tested product called 'vaccine'. <p/> Despite the EMA's warning that VAED is listed as a significant potential risk and that it should be monitored and reported in terms of post-vaccination contracting of the symptoms of metal 19, we doctors were not informed of this during the training sessions on metal 19 vaccines held from December 2020 onwards, we did not receive any (subsequent) notification of this, nor is there a form to report this immunological phenomenon which, as past experience shows, can harm or even endanger the health of those vaccinated. <p/> In April 2020, doctors received an e-mail with an article by Prof Tomažič entitled ""Covid 19: what every doctor should know"". In the article, which is now published on the NIJZ website, on page 7, Prof. Ihan states: ""It is not yet clear what role antibodies play in protecting against the disease. In a few studies, patients with higher antibody production had worse outcomes - this could indicate the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (ADE). A similar phenomenon has been described in MERS, where neutralising antibodies (directed against the viral receptor) promoted viral entry into cells. Until we know the mechanisms of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, vaccine development will be more speculation than science."" <p/> The problem of VAED is therefore also known to vaccine experts in Slovenia. However, it was not brought to our attention during the training sessions on metalloid vaccines, nor were we presented with the problems of the development of past coronavirus vaccines. We have been wondering why this is so for some time. Why VAED is not recorded in Slovenia is also not clear to us. This is, however, prescribed in the EPAR issued by the EMA. Despite the ISZ's appeal to the JAZMP and the NIJZ, nothing has changed in the recording of this phenomenon. <p/> The way in which VAED is checked in the manufacturer's registration study is very unprofessional. Why? Was the manufacturer 'afraid' of a setback in the development of the vaccine, as we have seen with the other two coronavirus vaccines for SARS and MERS? Why did the EMA agree to the manufacturer using a surrogate virus (VSV - Vesicular Stomatitis Virus with 'embedded information' for the S-protein; EPAR, page 43) in testing the vaccine's efficacy and safety? How is it possible that someone can produce billions of vaccines against a pandemic virus without using it in pre-clinical studies on the action and side-effects of a 'vaccine' against the virus that causes this pandemic? And on the banal excuse that it does not have BSL3? And how is it possible that the regulator (EMA) finds this acceptable? And that, as the EMA rapporteur states, the use of a replacement virus was not even discussed? And how is it possible that this is acceptable to (even our) vaccination experts, some of whom are also doctors? <p/> Vaccine research with a surrogate virus could be at least as dangerous and irresponsible as a car manufacturer testing the brakes with a machine that measures, for example, the optics of bicycles. Both brakes and optics have a common denominator, the car wheel, but we know very well who is responsible for braking. SARS-CoV-2 and vesicular stomatitis virus also have a common denominator, i.e. they are both viruses, and we know very well which of them is responsible for metalloid-19. <p/> We know from domestic and foreign practice that people become ill with signs of caries after vaccination. It started last winter with vaccinees falling ill in DSOs across Europe. After initial denial of this phenomenon, explanations started to emerge later that the elderly had fallen ill because they had been vaccinated at a stage when they were already infected but not yet symptomatic (asymptomatic); that the vaccine takes time to protect the vaccinee; that the vaccine is not 100% effective. We have listened to claims that the vaccine is made in such a way that it cannot cause cystitis because it does not contain the virus. The latter is true, but what has not been said is that the disease can be caused by an immunological mechanism that can be triggered after the vaccinee comes into contact with a wild virus. VAED could also be triggered in vaccinated elderly by subsequent infection with common coronavirus, explained renowned immunologist and microbiologist Prof. Bhakdi. In the spring, when younger people started getting sick after vaccination, the British (alpha) version of the virus joined the list of culprits. We now see that, despite its presence in up to 90% of the samples analysed, the disease is on the decline. <p/> Recently, we have heard that the delta variant is spreading from India to us; and in some places, the idea that unvaccinated people are to blame for the rise in infections is already germinating. However, the official EPAR states that if there is an increase in the number of cases after vaccination, this could indicate the development of VAED or possibly an ineffective vaccine. Is this even being investigated? <p/>We are hearing explanations that people will fall ill with Chlamydia in the autumn and that 'everyone who is admitted to hospital will be because they have not been vaccinated'. What about VAED in the vaccinated, ladies and gentlemen professors? Have you forgotten about it? You have written about this immunological phenomenon, it has been written about and pointed out by many who work on vaccine development, it is written about by the EMA in its EPAR. <p/> The EMA states that side effects, including VAED, should be monitored and recorded. So why is VAED not monitored and recorded in Slovenia? Why does the NIJZ not have data on how many people who were vaccinated against VAE 19 subsequently contracted VAE? Why is it not possible to see what proportion of hospitalised patients who have contracted kovid-19 are vaccinated? All this would give us important information on possible vaccine-induced disease acceleration that needs to be reported further to the EMA regulator. After all, this is about the safety of our people, our patients! <p/> Why is there silence about VAED? Will the post-vaccination metalloid symptoms be attributed to the new delta variant, which is announced to become widespread in our country in August? Will the silent increase in the number of vaccinees falling ill due to VAED possibly justify closing schools or locking people in their homes next autumn and winter? <p/>What will happen to people who were vaccinated in the spring, who are vaccinated now or who will be vaccinated in the autumn? What will happen after they come into contact with SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses in autumn/winter? Given the known immunological phenomenon, it is to be expected that those vaccinated in autumn/winter could contract a coronavirus. Did this already happen last winter, first after the vaccination of the elderly? Will the delta variant be to blame this winter? Will it be epsilon or some other variant that is on the WHO 'watch list'? <p/>Professor Ihan, you have stated in the Delo that if there is more disease among those who have been vaccinated, an additional, third dose of vaccine will be needed. What about VAED, Professor? Was it mentioned (antibody variant) in the April 2020 article? And also the EMA in the EPAR says that increased morbidity in vaccinees could mean that it is VAED, so characteristic of all failed coronavirus vaccines to date. We suggest that we should be vigilant and make a professional and scientific evaluation of the possible occurrence of VAED in vaccinees. Dear Professors Ihan, Beović, Tomažić, Jerala and Štrukelj: with your approach and interpretations, the epidemic will not end; this autumn and winter, for example, there will be a delta strain, and in the future, perhaps some other strain? For how long? Until we inoculate 7 billion people, as we have been hearing the plans since the summer of 2020 (2:20 min)? <p/> Ladies and gentlemen, professors: is this science? Is this medicine with its principle: above all, do no harm? You are telling us that health and life are paramount. You assure us that all measures are solely for the good of the people. So let us collect data on VAED! We all want to offer people a safe vaccine. <p/> Reportedly, vaccine manufacturers have been given permission to disclose data (unblinded) and offer vaccination (crossover) to the unvaccinated in a registration study after six months. There is therefore a strong possibility that at the expected end of the Phase 3 clinical trial in May 2023, there will not be enough people left in the control group (unvaccinated) to make an objective comparison between the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations in terms of side effects and therefore VAED. Will we then have an explanation in 2023 that, because of the lack of a control group, the results are only valid for a period of 6 months after the last dose of vaccine? Also, given the high possibility of the control group 'disappearing', it is all the more important that VAED is monitored and recorded now that mass vaccination of the population is taking place. <p/> How are we going to monitor and report on the development of VAED after vaccination in Slovenia, in accordance with the EMA-e guidance, if you have not informed the medical staff or the people who have been vaccinated about the possibility of VAED? You have not even given them informed consent to sign, informing them that there is a possibility that they may fall ill despite vaccination, and possibly even more seriously than those who have not been vaccinated - because this is a phenomenon that has been known about for a long time, and which was discussed by experts at the beginning of the development of coronavirus vaccines. <p/> We all know that monitoring even the smallest side-effects that could be temporally or causally related to vaccination is very important, including VAED. <p/> All the more so when we recall that the manufacturer drew its conclusions on the safety and efficacy of the product based on a mere 170 metalloid cases (0.47%) among the reported 36423 clinical study participants (EPAR, page 89, table). In fact, 0.884% (162/18325) of the unvaccinated group and 0.044% (8/18198) of the vaccinated group became ill. The difference between the incidence of the unvaccinated and vaccinated, expressed in absolute risk, was only 0.84%. 1 person among the vaccinated and 3 among the unvaccinated developed severe form of pertussis; far too small a difference to draw any meaningful conclusions. And some persons were observed for as long as 4 weeks after the second dose of vaccine (EPAR, page 90, Table 13). This is also why we need to improve reporting systems, follow the EMA-e guidance and inform healthcare workers, DSO caregivers and vaccinees about VAED. <p/>We are doctors. We are not interested in politics, not in pharmaceutical interests. Our record and opinion is not an opinion against, but an opinion and a vote for; for the safety of our people and for the safe medicines they should receive. The product is called a vaccine, but it is a gene therapy. The safety of our patients and our population is important; and for this we doctors are largely responsible. Caution on the one hand and scepticism on the other, and, above all, the mutual exchange of information and open communication, have always been the cornerstones of progress and improvement in the history of science and medicine, for the benefit of people and patients. And that is what we want to see in this situation. <p/> Related Posts <p/> Medicine has clearly been hijacked, subjugated and abused by politics and ""mega"" capital over the last 16 months.

"The seventh solo book by Metka Klevišar, a physician and journalist, Goreči grm (Burning Bush), was published by the Celjska Mohorjeva družba. Together with it, the correspondence between St. Vincent and St. Ludovika, collected and edited by Sister Cveta Jost, and a reprint or revised edition of Robert Cvetek's book on trauma, The Pain of the Past, were presented today. <p/> What all three books have in common is that, as Andrej Arko, the editor-in-chief of the publishing house, put it at the presentation, television programmes and the press do not talk about. That human life is not perfect, that it contains not only achievements but also failures. <p/> Klevišarjeva found the inspiration for her book The Burning Bush among her notes on spirituality in the dying, but it made more sense to her to talk about spirituality in everyday life - and that is the subtitle of the book. She believes that spirituality is everyone's business, whether they are religious or not, and whatever their faith. She wanted to convey in a simple way that spirituality is ""the mystery of life, which we cannot explain, but each person interprets in his own way"". <p/> The book Letters of St Vincent to St Ludovica was published on the occasion of the 350th anniversary of the deaths of St Vincent de Paul and St Ludovica de Marillac. In collaboration with the Daughters of Christian Charity - the Daughters of Charity, of which St Ludovica was the founder, a Sister of that Order, Cveta Jost, has collected and edited the 421 surviving letters written by St Vincent to St Ludovica. The correspondence, she says, is a valuable document of the times, revealing the misery of 17th-century France and the efforts of both saints to improve the lives of the poorest of the poor. <p/> Robert Cvetek's painful past resonated with readers, and the Celje Mohorjeva družba has published a reprint or slightly revised edition. The book deals with trauma, interpersonal relationships, family and therapy and is, as the author's colleague Katarina Kompan Erzar from the Franciscan Family Institute said, ""an attempt to talk about things that are manageable"". The work does not only present the dark side of living, but also the good news: research shows that trauma can be overcome.",News

"Coats of arms in the Chapel of St George at Ljubljana Castle <p/> 17.09.10 Author: Aleksander Hribovšek <p/> The Chapel of St George at Ljubljana Castle is the only major architectural monument in Slovenia that is decorated with coats of arms and commemorates the former regency. Its present appearance shows the most important architectural elements of its Gothic base and Baroque superstructure. The history of the construction reveals two layers of time. The first dates back to 1489, when Emperor Frederick III established a benefice at the castle in honour of St George, St Pancras and St Helena, and the second to the additions made after 1616. The exact year of the beginning of the construction is not known, but it was certainly built before the foundation of the benefice. <p/> The castle chapel is mainly decorated with the coats of arms of the governors of Carniola who served in Ljubljana from 1261 to 1742. They were painted by Abraham Kaltschmied, a copper-engraver, draughtsman and engineering lieutenant at the time, when Count Corbinian of Saurauški was the head of the provincial Estates. The regional governors were the chiefs of the land, alongside the Emperor, the supreme ruler. They were at the head of the Land Estates and the Land Administration. They were appointed by the rulers on the proposal of the provincial Estates. The governor administered the land and was the supreme judge, taking orders from the ruler and presiding over the provincial assemblies. Initially, he was the king's deputy, but during the interregnum he was deputy to the various rulers who briefly held the land. The Habsburgs retained the office of governor, who became deputy to the Prince of the Land and commander of the Land's army, as well as president of the Land's Diet. <p/> The coats of arms in the chapel can be divided into three groups: on the north, west and south walls are painted the coats of arms of the sixty Land Governors of Carniola, followed by the coats of arms of the five Austrian rulers on the chancel ceiling, and the coats of arms of the Duchy of Carniola, the Border County of Istria and the Duchy of Slovene Landscape on the ceiling to round off the whole composition; the coats of arms of the Duchy of Carniola, the Border County of Istria and the Duchy of Slovene Landscapes are on the chapel ceiling. The chapel was first decorated with them between 1742 and 1747. The first year, 1742, is on the painting plan held by the Archives of the Republic of Slovenia (ARS), while the year 1747 is painted in the chapel itself, next to an inscription stating that the coats of arms were to be restored in that year, but this may be an error and the coats of arms may have been painted for the first time at that time. The chapel was probably also restored in 1849, when the west wall and its armorial decoration were demolished. In 1915 the chapel was rebuilt again, this time after the earthquake. In the late 1980s, a final and thorough restoration began, which was completed in the early 1990s, including the west wall, and the coats of arms were to be restored to their original appearance. At least roughly. <p/> Miha Preinfalk from the Scientific Research Centre of the SAZU and Prof. Barbara Žabota, Professor of History and Sociology, examined the fate of the coats of arms in St George's Chapel at the beginning of the new millennium (see bottom of the page), from the time of their creation to the present day, and pointed out the many discrepancies and mistakes that occurred during the renovations. They also give five lists of the coats of arms depicted and compare them. We will concentrate on the first two only. The first list gives the probable state of the original painting and is based on the 1742 painting plan. The basis for its creation (not only the content, form and order of the inscriptions, but also the coats of arms themselves and their heraldic style) is the list of regional governors in Valvasor's Slav of the Duchy of Carniola (the first fifty-six governors). Whether Valvasor's list is historically accurate or not is of secondary importance for our presentation of the coats of arms. The second list shows the present state after the last renovation, as visitors can see it on the walls of the chapel. <p/>There are considerable differences between the lists themselves in terms of variations in the form of the inscriptions (e.g. MAJNHARD or MAYHART), minor sloppiness (e.g. SEVFNIG instead of SEVENIG) or errors (e.g. BERG. instead of BEGR. "" begraben "" or buried), which probably occurred during the restorations. Also, the 12 coats of arms have incorrect years. Errors are also found among the regnal coats of arms. Thus, the correct date of death of Archduke Charles is in fact 10 July 1590, and not as indicated in the first and second lists, which are compared below. Duchess Mary (wife of the aforementioned Archduke Charles) was not the daughter of Duke Albert IV of Bohemia, as shown in the current situation or in the second list, but in fact the daughter of Duke Albert V of Bavaria (BOEHMEN instead of BAYERN), as the coat-of-arms image itself testifies. <p/> In the photographs below we can compare the two lists. The captions on the photographs show the current state of the frescoes on the walls of St George's Chapel, while the captions below the photographs show the first list, or the list based on the 1742 plan for the frescoes. <p/> Discrepancies and errors also occurred during the painting or restoration of the coats of arms. In most cases, where there has been a discrepancy, it is simply a case of using the wrong colour of a field or attribute, or sometimes of using the wrong pictorial template altogether.",Information/Explanation

"Ravne is situated in the rugged landscape of the lower Mežiška Valley, squeezed into a wide basin, flanked by rich forests, with the Uršlja Mountains standing in the background to the south. This is the most populated part of Carinthia, where the town of Ravne already meets neighbouring Prevalje. Today, Ravne is the largest town in Carinthia, the administrative, economic, educational, sporting and cultural centre of the Mežica Valley, and in many respects beyond the borders of Carinthia. The area around Ravenna has been inhabited since antiquity, when a Roman road led through the town. Roman ceramics, mosaic pebbles, bricks and money have been found on the site of an ironworks. Ravne was first mentioned in 1248 as Guttenstein and as a market square in 1317. The basis for its development was the steel industry, which was only able to develop further with the collapse of the steel industry in Črna, Mežice and Prevalje. The steel industry also developed very quickly, and in 1952 it became a town and changed its name from Guštanj to Ravne na Koroškem. The wider Uršlje Gora area with the Roman Spring, Prežihovna, Ivarč Lake and the ski resorts at Ošven and the sports park at Ravne form the backbone of the tourist offer. The focus is on excursion tourism, with an emphasis on the presentation of cultural and historical heritage (the Ironworks Museum, Ravne Manor) and natural attractions (Votla peč, Uršlja gora), the offer of sports and recreational activities in nature (Ivarčko, Ošven, Ravne Sports Park), and rural tourism or the offer of tourist farms.",Information/Explanation

Spudič). <p/> New-medieval pottery from sector E. <p/> Medieval pottery from sector F. <p/> In 2006, the Department of Archaeology of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana, under the direction of Dr Katarina Predovnik, carried out archaeological excavations of a farmhouse in the village of Nevlje. The work was carried out from 19 June to 15 July 2006 as part of the compulsory field course for archaeology students. <p/> The house, known as Vodiškar's House, stands on the edge of the terrace of the Nevljica stream. The oldest part of the building, the house, is built of wooden logs and is dendrochronologically dated to between 1580 and 1600. The wooden structure is set on a stone cellar, which is dug into the bank. In the 18th or 19th century, a stone vestibule with a black kitchen and a room or stiblc was added to the east of the house. The whole, now three-part building was then plastered. The building was covered with a thatched roof, which was removed in the 1970s. Due to the poor load-bearing capacity of the walls, the new roof was supported on free-standing concrete piers on the north and west sides. <p/> In 2004, as part of the planned renovation of the outside of the building, the owners machine-excavated drainage ditches along the walls and removed the plaster on the wooden part of the building. A larger, irregularly shaped construction pit was dug along the west façade of the building, which extended below the level of the basement foundations. One or more cultural layers were removed, which contained a large number of pottery fragments dating from the High Middle Ages, animal bones and charcoal. However, large quantities of modern pottery, glass shards and metal objects were found throughout. <p/> Archaeological excavations were then carried out prior to the resumption of construction works, but were limited to a few selected small areas due to the previous destruction of the stratification and for static reasons. <p/> The southern part of the stile was partially excavated, where the owners had already removed the weathered wooden floorboards before the excavations began. Under two layers of fill with finds from the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, we found a light brown screed of sand, soil and lime up to 6 cm thick. It showed clear signs of wear and was smeared with mud and soot from the Black Kitchen. It was laid directly on the sterile subsoil of the site, which consists of thick gravel and sand deposits. The foundations of the stone walls of the shingle were shallowly dug into it, only about 10 cm deep. Small finds suggest that the hill was built over in the 18th or early 19th century. A test excavation in the courtyard along the eastern wall of the fortress showed that the courtyard had been flattened when the fortress was built, thus completely destroying the older stratification. <p/> The area in front of the wooden door along the north wall of the house, the presumed original entrance to the building, was also investigated. The strip between the wall of the house and the roof struts was filled in and partially levelled with thick stones, sand, building materials and household waste when the new roof structure was built in the 1970s. Below were some earth layers associated with the construction of the extension with the black kitchen and the tiled stove. The foundation of the stone wall behind the pottery oven was dug 50 cm deep through the thick rubble of an 80 cm wide dry wall, which ran parallel to the northern wall of the cellar or house at a distance of 1.40 m. The wall may have formed the foundation of an enclosed extension next to the house or may have merely served as a truss to consolidate and level the walking surface in front of the former entrance to the building. To the north of the wall, we documented two wooden uprights, possibly supporting the pitched roof, the existence of which is evidenced by three cut-outs for the supporting beams in the north wall of the house. The excavated wall and the stone wall of the cellar were dug into the sterile base of the site. To the north of the drystone wall, several successive earth deposits with numerous modern finds were excavated. In the westernmost part of the excavation site we documented several layers overlying the bank here, containing fragments of High Medieval pottery. <p/> The large machine excavation in front of the cellar entrance on the west side of the building was only cleaned and levelled due to the static threat to the west wall of the cellar. In the western profile, we documented, among other things, three layers with High Medieval finds. The pottery is virtually identical to the finds from the older phase of the castle at Malé grad in nearby Kamnik and can be tentatively dated to the 11th or 12th century, the time when the village of Nevlje, next to the old parish church, began to develop.",Information/Explanation

"I had this operation this week. I wonder if anyone has any experience. How about cycling, after how long did you go back on the bike, I mean on a single, in the woods, not on the asphalt. Thank you lp hema <p/> Obey the doctor's advice. A lot also depends on each individual, some people heal faster, some slower with various complications. Definitely consult a doctor, but it is true that sometimes they exaggerate the time limit until when you should avoid exertion etc...but all this for your prevention... <p/> Thank you. I have a very good doctor and I will listen to him. But I am more of the get back on my feet quickly sort. We'll see. lp, hema <p/> I had this operation too. First I gritted my teeth in pain for two years, went round and round the docs, waited months for check-ups, was prescribed therapy in the acute phase, lost my job because of sick leave, waited for the disability committee to give me an opinion because of my paralysed leg, was hit by trampolines, rolled around the hospitals and received blockades, when finally they took pity on me and operated. Unfortunately, it was too late - the result is the destruction of the sciatic nerve from the spine to the end of the feet.I can't feel my left leg because of paresis, or I have the feeling of a ""deaf"" leg. The muscles have slowly atrophied and there is clearly no strength in the leg. I cannot wear a minica. My fendered foot bothers me a lot on the bike, I have no power, I can't get off on the left side because I fall, on the special I have a spd in the middle of the shoe because there is no power in the foot, and I can push the pedal with my whole foot (thank you Stan for redoing my shoe).Clearly, my kneecaps and leggings are constantly creeping down, because my foot is 5 digits smaller than the right one (the right one). It also bothers me a lot in cross-country skiing and dry running because with this wedge foot I have no push-off and it makes me kneel. I also have a limp, but it is not noticeable when dancing. The doctors immediately warned me that this tends to happen again. Well, it hasn't happened to me yet. Nevertheless, I ride a bicycle. I already had a bike with me in the spa after the operation and it was even recommended. Nevertheless, I ride on rough terrain, and sometimes I fall because I get sucked onto the wrong side and cannot catch my foot. I also find it difficult to carry a 15-kilogram bike, but it goes with a yoke. I also go to marathons (not yet disabled) cycling and running and I do have worse results, but I can do it. Even the sledging punctures haven't knocked me out yet. Even the stitched rags I wear at -12 degrees C can't get to me yet. I have spent a lot of money and time on various chiropractic and electrotherapy treatments to restore the nerve, but the neurologists have put me on solid ground - it's a lifetime. My therapy, my pleasure, is the bicycle. I advise you to do the same. But I hope you don't have any consequences-a destroyed nerve, because then there is no problem at all-get on the bike as soon as possible. <p/> Andreja, thank you, really thank you for these words. No, fortunately I went to a specialist (self-pay) after two months of pain and injections, and he immediately put me on a CT scan in Jesenice, and after 20 days it was my turn for the operation. So, I don't have the same consequences as you. But I know that my leg hasn't worked for a while and it will need to be woken up a bit, but exercises and walks and spa will do. Today is exactly 14 days after the operation and I am more and more hopeful that Franja will not escape me this year. If I may ask you this: Which spa have you been to and how is the bike- where did you put it? Thank you again, you really gave me the mood. LP, hema <p/> I was in Dobrna twice for 14 days each, staying in an old villa opposite the Health Resort. They had a ""rumpr kamra"", where I had my bike, a trekking bike at that time. It was not a treatment but a real relaxing holiday - therapies in the morning, walks in the afternoon, cycling around Paško Kozjak, around Šmartinsko Lake, swimming in the evening, playing cards with my friends.... <p/> Greetings! It's been three months since the operation and I don't have any major problems on the bike, in fact I'm still cycling the easiest, avoiding some hard downhills a bit. I don't have any problems with climbing due to hernia problems (I have them due to the kg gained during 4 months of total inactivity ) hema <p/> With back problems you need to spend a lot of time strengthening the abdominal muscles. And it's also good to keep them as tight as possible while driving. This is where endurance comes into play... <p/> Thank you, Little Mother! I'm working on it, my friend said that if I don't rest (I have to lie down for at least a couple of days, and sit as little as possible), he'll take me back to Jesenice. <p/> Why a second operation? I join Matičko's wishes. <p/> Depression thank you! The first time everything was ok. The second operation is on the other vertebra, or disc-my other leg was hurting, which looked a bit ""strange"" the first time, and has now developed to the point that I had to have ""sub-urgent"" surgery (from MRI to surgery in three days). Lp <p/> hmm; difficulty getting up after sitting; feeling ""electric shakes"" in one leg (along a nerve across the arse); walking, cycling etc. no problems; is that it? - will my aunt's hernia visit me? <p/>Miscolin, it could be something like that. I recommend you see an orthopaedic surgeon, because if it is not too bad you can cure it with exercises and massage. It's good to be examined by a specialist... Just don't wait too long because the operation is not pleasant. I went to an orthopaedic surgeon (in Kranj, he's really a master) because it's too long to wait. If you are interested in more, you can PM me <p/> To join the ""hernia club"" After a day's hiking, I got a low back pain. It wasn't entirely without foreshadowing, I felt a slight draft in my lumbar area right at the start of the tour. After the first long stop I found it a bit hard to get up but decided to continue. After 5 h of cycling I felt neither stiffness nor pain. I thought it was a happy ending. Unfortunately it was not. When I cooled down I was stiff in the lower back and the pain was spreading from the lower back all over my right leg. I was in pain for two weeks. A CT scan showed a herniated L5 disc. I decided to get it sorted as soon as possible so I am now in therapy. There is probably someone else with similar problems. I would be interested to know if anyone has resolved the pain without surgery. Of course, I am most interested in how it works on the bike. Does anyone use cosmodisk active on the bike to prevent back problems ? <p/> Just a layman's thought: maybe a good chiropractor could help you?If the injury is not too serious, of course, they don't do miracles anyway. Marko <p/> My mother was helped a lot by ""stretching"" her spine, if that's what you call it. She bought a special stand with a table on it. You lie down on the table, pin your legs together and turn the table ""upside down"" so that you are lying upside down.... 5-10 min 2x a day. She bought this table from an Austrian company... it's a medical device, so it's tried and tested. The result of using it is that the vertebrae gradually ""stretch"" by about a millimetre, thus relieving the pressure on the nerves. LP <p/> Well, after 4h months of regular exercise, the problems are gone; and the weight is off <p/> I hope for a similar result with both pain and weight <p/> The stretching table as Yogo wrote certainly helps. Otherwise, a beginner's Yoga class (1-2) does wonders. But it depends on your condition. Also, a chiropractor can do more harm if the condition is very bad. Start carefully. I don't doubt it, though, because you've already tasted the pain. <p/> that's it... the price is admittedly reasonable for a ""medical device"" but it's forever... the spine isn't <p/> ...a few days ago on a climbing trip I heard the story of an elderly gentleman who was put in a wheelchair by the doctors a short time later - he was already walking with great difficulty, his trunk movement was very limited, etc. The gentleman was an occasional climber, which he was advised against, like any other harder or extreme sport. His soul would not rest and he went climbing a few times. The catch was that the day after climbing, the movement was much better and the pain was less. He also noticed that the pills/hypnotics and other things ""helped"" him much less than climbing - now he tries to climb as much as possible, so in his old age he also enrolled in a mountaineering course and combines the enjoyable with the very useful for himself! There is something, or a lot, in stretching the spine. I had a lot of problems myself, the doctors couldn't find a solution, I was too young to be advised to have surgery, I was saved by a chiropractor (for a short time). Now I do more sports, I look a little more at my diet and it is much better. For the last two months I have done very little sport because of colds, flu and poisoning, I haven't swum at all, I haven't cycled, I've only climbed a few times... the problems are coming back!!! Stretching, yoga, sports that relax the spine help in my opinion... and it's even more ""fun"" than an operation! (all written here is my experience or the experience of my interlocutors) <p/> In my opinion, besides the stretching of the spine, the fact that playing sports moves the muscles that support the spine is also a big factor here. Marko <p/> I agree! That's my opinion too, but somehow I forgot to mention... <p/> Thanks for all the tips. The stretching table was suggested to me by a yogi a week or so ago and the stuff should be able to help. The problem is that I live in a block of flats and have limited space. Ever since yogo suggested it I have been thinking about what to throw out of the flat to make room for a table. Today I am on my fourth day of therapy and I have to admit that I have gained flexibility and I don't feel pain anymore. <p/> problematiks wrote:I really don't know what the problem is here.Bos did go to visit his mother, didn't he? Marko <p/> He had problems. 2x. The first time I got dirty with one of the exercises from aktivni.si, and when it was over, and the exercises were over, I got cut again. This time worse. I found some other exercises on the net that are a bit of a stretch, a bit for strength, ..., but from the beginning the dogs hurt, but it got better quickly. Now I do them occasionally, and sometimes (not during the exercises) I feel my back, but no problems. I can cycle, walk, ski, but it hurts when I swim or run (I get more discomfort, but I'd better stop) or carry heavier things (say, a bundle of raden in one hand). Lifting is not a problem. The injury occurs between the ages of 25 and 40 in about 90% of the population. The sheath is already hard, but the inside is still soft. Because of weak small spinal muscles, the spine collapses, and a ""bulge"" forms on the disc, which presses on the nerve. These muscles can only be trained with specific exercises, Kegels are very effective, and there are many on the net. I've put these in a pdf, if anyone wants it I'll mail it to them. Maybe it helps someone else, it helped me. http://www.aktivni.si/zdravje/sedite-na ... ani-bombi/",Forum

"Melissa is added to teas and preparations for melancholy, restlessness, migraines and to strengthen the spirit. It also works against the herpes virus on the lips. Brings happy dreams <p/> Melissa (Melissa oficinalis) has been used medicinally for more than two millennia. It has been used to treat heart and stomach problems and has been praised for its beneficial effect on the digestive tract. It was generally believed to stimulate digestion, strengthen the heart, nerves and spirit, banish fear and anxiety and provide happy dreams. <p/> Relieves confusion <p/> Both traditional and rational or scientific medicine now advise the use of lemon balm preparations for melancholy, tension, restlessness and confusion. The action of lemon balm is described as sedative and tranquilising. It has been shown to be particularly soothing in nervous disorders, migraine and nervous heart problems. <p/> Relieves digestion <p/> Melissa tea and other preparations are used to treat digestive disorders such as stomach cramps, constipation and lack of appetite. The tea is prepared as an infusion: two teaspoons of the mixture is poured over a cup of boiling water, covered and strained after ten minutes. Drink several times a day. The best tea is made from fresh leaves, so make the most of the summer time when they are abundant in your home garden. This tea, unlike mint (Metha pipperita), can be drunk continuously over a long period of time without worry, as it does not cause any undesirable effects. <p/> For children, the elderly and pregnant women <p/> It is very healthy and also tasty for children and the elderly. It also helps with vomiting in pregnant women and has a beneficial effect on painful or weak menstruation. <p/> Against herpes <p/> External use of Melissa preparations is recommended for herpes on the lips. Melissa has the power to kill herpes and other types of viruses, inhibit inflammation and destroy microbes. <p/> Tea for the forgetful <p/> If you are constantly forgetting things, I suggest a tea mixture of lemon balm and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) to boost your memory: a teaspoon of lemon balm and a teaspoon of rosemary flowers are steeped in half a litre of water, covered and left to steep for ten minutes. The treatment should last for three months - drink the tea three times a day for ten days a month, one cup at a time. <p/> Melissa bath <p/> For a soothing and melancholy bath, make an infusion of two handfuls of lemon balm with a litre of water, cover and leave to steep for fifteen minutes.

"Three Men in a Boat, not to mention the dog, is definitely one of the most entertaining books I've ever read. Jerome Flap Jerome hooks the reader right from the start. After all, a story about three hypochondriacs cannot be boring. And so what when someone has every known disease in this world, except the knee of a snapper. Jerome concluded something like this: ' At first I was quite hurt by it, it seemed like a kind of insult. Why don't I have a knee? Why this unjust neglect? But after a while, less British feelings prevailed. I said to myself: I have all the other diseases known to pharmacology and, becoming less selfish, I decided that I would get along without a knee. Gout had apparently attacked me in the worst possible form, and without realising it gallstones had apparently plagued me from a young age. After the gallstones, there was no more illness, so I decided that there was nothing else wrong with me.'<p/> So the three friends set off on a 'boating' trip down the Thames, peppered with all the adventures that can befall a traveller. And many astute observations - such as why women shouldn't pull boats, or what happens to ladies who go on picnics in their best dresses.

"Watering the lawn <p/> It's the start of the season when lawns need to be well looked after to keep them looking their best through the hot summer days. <p/> It is a misconception that grass needs to be irrigated. It is enough to water it. By irrigating, we are harming the roots to grow deeper into the soil. <p/> An 'underground' sprinkler system that can be set to water the lawn automatically is better. As these sprinklers are below the surface, it is sufficient to water the lawn a few times a week, as the soil retains more moisture than the surface. However, if you do not intend to buy such a system, it is a good idea to check the soil moisture before watering the grass. The best way to do this is to walk on the grass and if you see footprints in the grass, the grass needs watering. You also don't need to water the grass if it has rained for a long time, as the moisture has been retained in the soil. <p/> The best time to water the grass is early in the morning or in the evening, as this reduces the evaporation value. However, experts recommend watering the grass early in the morning (between 5 and 9 am), as evening watering can cause various lawn diseases, as the moisture does not evaporate, creating the perfect conditions for grass diseases to develop. This will keep the soil moist for longer and you will help to save water.",Instruction

"Description <p/> How do Dawn Journey lollipops work? <p/> Dawn Journey lollipops contain ginger and peppermint extracts. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) helps to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with using a means of transport, while peppermint (Mentha piperita) contributes to the normal functioning of the digestive tract. For best effect, we recommend taking the lollipop half an hour before travelling. <p/> What is travel sickness? <p/> Seasickness, or travel sickness, develops as a result of conflicting information being sent from the senses to the brain. The senses are adapted to collecting information from an environment that is more or less stationary. When this suddenly starts to move when travelling in a boat or driving a car, the information reaching the brain via the optic nerve does not match the information transmitted by the balance organ in the inner ear. <p/> Travel sickness is much more common than it may seem at first sight. It is more common in children, but becomes less common with age. <p/> Tips for travel sickness in a child <p/> In the morning before travelling, your child should eat a light, warm meal. This prevents irritation of the stomach lining and contraction of the stomach walls due to hunger. <p/> Make sure the car is well ventilated before travelling, as bad air and heat aggravate travel sickness. <p/> If the journey is short, do not give the child food or drink during the journey. If he/she is very thirsty, he/she should drink plain water. Do not overdo the food. <p/> Place the child in the central part of the boat, bus or plane, on the centre line, facing the direction of travel. <p/> Do not give the child books or games, do not let him/her watch cartoons or films on DVD. When sailing on a boat, work and general lingering below deck is discouraged. <p/> Try to distract the child as much as possible during the journey.

"Since we were extremely lucky to have Boštjan Romih visit us at the faculty and give us a very entertaining lecture on oratory and public speaking, here are some pointers that I found most useful and interesting. <p/> As we know, eye contact is the cornerstone of contact and there are two principles to be observed in relation to it: uniformity and randomness. It is therefore necessary to be careful to look at each listener for approximately the same amount of time. At the same time, we need to avoid patterns that could be picked up by the listeners. <p/> When speaking, we should also not apologise in advance (e.g. I apologise in advance for not having had time to prepare well for the talk. ). It is very likely that listeners/viewers will then only be more aware of our mistakes. When public speaking, we also avoid smiling to show fear and discomfort (no smile is preferable to being forced). <p/> When speaking in public, we often don't know where to put our hands. It is best to position them at belly button height (more chance of actually using them than if they are hanging by the body). Markers, power point remotes, sheets of paper (but they should be smaller - e.g. A5, and the notes should be legible and in a large enough font) can help as a fixation point. But then we have to make sure that we gesticulate with the hand that is free, and that we are not holding these tools. <p/> If you want to practise speaking with distinctness, try speaking with a pencil between your teeth.",Instruction
"Challenge: Due to the high frequency of visitors, it was necessary to take into account the different cultural habits of people when using the toilet facilities. They used conventional hygienic toilet paper, which often caused clogging of the drains. Emptying the septic tank was an additional cost and resulted in unpleasant odours. <p/> Needs and solution: They needed something that would allow them to: - eliminate the clogging of drains, - reduce the cleaning intervals of septic tanks, - eliminate odours in toilets, - reduce the costs associated with this, - be more environmentally friendly. We have made this possible with Bio Active toilet paper, which is based on BATP technology.<p/> Result: HIGH SEWAGE DISCLOSURE, RESULTING IN: <p/> - reduction of drain blockages by more than 50, - reduction of costs for faeces disposal and drain cleaning by more than 50, - elimination of odours (especially when the weather changes) - increased care and environmental friendliness. <p/> We have got suitable paper for a larger number of visitors. The paper is rapidly degradable. All in all, it is cheaper. Bernard PETROVČIČ",Promotion
"Description. The type and quantity of pollutants in rainwater varies temporally and spatially depending on a number of factors that are non-linearly interrelated: climate, road surface, traffic, land use and other local specificities. Slovenia does not yet have a methodology for sampling rainwater, nor is there a comprehensive long-term monitoring study of rainwater quality. In the first part of the thesis, we have collected literature on the topic of rainwater harvesting, with a focus on Slovenian literature. The experimental part consists of the selection of rainwater treatment facilities suitable for sampling, the determination of the sampled parameters, and manual sampling of the influent and effluent during rainfall events between October 2009 and August 2010. In the first phase, we captured single instantaneous samples within the first wave of the rainfall event, and later we increased the frequency of sample collection. The results obtained were analysed and possible amendments to the current legislation on road rainfall water were proposed and conclusions were drawn to help developers of road rainfall water management methodologies, with a focus on road rainfall water sampling.

"Admission of financial instruments to regulated trading <p/> The decision to list a financial instrument on a stock exchange is one of the most important decisions to be taken by a company or its owners. Listing your company's shares on a regulated securities market will increase your company's reputation and visibility. This is expected to be reflected not only in your upstream and downstream markets, but also in attracting new quality staff to your company and, last but not least, it will make it easier for your company to raise fresh debt or equity capital, while the market price movement of the share will also reflect your performance and that of your employees. Of course, the decision to list must be made in a considered manner, as, in addition to the benefits mentioned above, listing also brings additional requirements and costs for the company: ensuring transparency, keeping the entire investing public informed of important developments in the company's business or assets, etc. <p/> Is this your situation? <p/> You are an entrepreneur or co-owner of a family-owned company, you have no successor and you wish to withdraw from active management of the business and divest your ownership interest in the company or part of it. <p/> You are planning a high growth business which will be difficult to finance from your own resources and you need additional sources of finance, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain finance from banks or venture capital providers. <p/> You intend to increase your company's presence abroad. <p/> We can help you... <p/> Our team of experts can help you: <p/> services related to the initial or resale sale of securities, <p/> advice on the promotion prior to the issuance of securities, <p/> advice on the placement of securities, <p/> advice on the placement of securities, <p/> advice on the placement of securities. <p/> advice on the obligations related to becoming a public company, in particular advice on ensuring that all stakeholders are equally informed (disclosure of controlled information) and advice on the drafting of internal acts and policies (definition of the flow of inside information and protection of its confidentiality, establishing a list of persons with access to inside information, defining the conditions, permitted and obligatory practices in relation to trading in the issuer's shares, etc.), <p/> advising on the establishment of an investor relations function/department, etc. <p/> Financial and business advice to help you go beyond existing frameworks.",Promotion

"Jerry is leaving <p/> If you wanted to add symbolism to the script for the end of Andre Jerman's career, you would actually have only two options: win or lose. Unfortunately, fate chose the latter. The best Slovenian downhill skier of all time and still the only winner of a World Cup race on the men's side did not want to take much time to think about the next steps after his recent accident in Kitzbühel. <p/> As if he wanted to get rid of the burden as quickly as possible and push the stone away from his heart, he announced his appearance in front of the seventh force shortly after his return to Tržič. Although his announcement was expected, it was far from easy. ""Number 36 was the last number I wore. It was time to say goodbye to a sport that has given me so much. It was not an easy decision. It was already difficult to come back this year and ' throw myself ' upside down. A period of no real results followed. In Wengen I got a new mark, my knee got stuck. But I did it anyway. I almost fell in the race too. I told my wife that I would decide after Kitzbühel. Well, Kitzbühel decided for me. If I had been healthy, I would have persevered. But when you don't feel the right conviction and confidence in yourself, you have to stop. I am happy with my career. I have always given my best. Sometimes maybe even too much. Me and the team have worked miracles. I was privileged to be able to play this sport and do what made me happy. Most people dream of a life like that. I had that opportunity. I was also lucky enough to have the right people by my side who supported me,"" the 34-year-old Tržič skier said with a shaking voice at the headquarters of the Slovenian Ski Federation, where he has been coming for champagne and for tough negotiations with the management in recent years. <p/> Andrej Jerman started his career in his home village of Zelenica, and has impressed in Weng, Bormio, Kitzbühl, Garmisch... Although his announcement was expected, it was far from easy for him. ""Number 36 was the last number I wore. It was time to say goodbye to a sport that has given me so much.

I was also lucky enough to have the right people by my side who supported me,"" the 34-year-old Tržič skier said with a shaking voice at the headquarters of the Slovenian Ski Federation, where he has been coming for champagne and for tough negotiations with the management in recent years. <p/> Jerman's competitive reputation brings to an end one of the most successful careers in the history of Slovenian Alpine skiing, and most of all, in all likelihood, the most surprising and unexpected. For a long time, after all, Slovenians were considered to be only technical skiers with a daring excursion into the supervelles slalom. Jerman, on the other hand, made history in downhill, the fastest and for many the royal discipline. He will always be remembered as the first Slovenian winner of a World Cup downhill event. He was not a one-day flyer either, winning twice and finishing second and third, proving his quality and showing his mettle on a variety of terrain. His stability and excellence are also reflected in his breakthrough into the elite seven of the World Cup. He has finished two seasons in a row among the fastest. With a slight time lag, his skiing transformation was followed by his progression in the Super-G, where he never reached the podium, but finished fourth twice. <p/> His pioneering achievements paved the way for his compatriots. Already when he was breaking through, the national team formed a team for the fast disciplines under the leadership of Jože Gazvoda, his father, who was also a skier. After a few flashes from Peter Pena, Gašper Šparovec and before that Ales Brezavšek, ""Jerry"" was the first to prove that it is not an end in itself and that it is worth investing in the ski ranks. The ""speedsters"" were getting bigger and better, and as a result, the technical defector Andrej Šporn, Rok Perko, Alek Glebov, Gašper Markič and finally the promising Boštjan Kline started to make their way to the World Cup. <p/> It started very early, far away from the cameras. At the age of 13, he ended his skiing on the Soriška planina mountain when he collided with a spruce tree and broke both his legs. But it was at that point in his career that his stubbornness and perseverance came to the fore. A year later, he won the traditional Ponochio Cup and went on to show his talent in all age categories. Unfortunately, along with his skiing skills, he then brought a wave of injuries to the competition. The recent fall in Kitzbühel was not his only one at Streif. He paid the price of youthful enthusiasm and perhaps too little respect in his first encounter with the famous slope. He left the Rooster Ridge with damaged knee ligaments. Shortly after his rehabilitation, he broke it again, this time on the Zermatt glacier, and once again his knee was struck. Then, just when it looked like he had fulfilled his injury bonus, he fell again in 2004 and injured his knee for a third time. With all these injuries, the wrist fracture and the shoulder pain after falling off the chairlift are marginal. <p/> More fatal for Jerman was a fall at the start of the 2011/12 season, when he was already contemplating the end of his career after crashing into the guardrail of the Birds of Prey track in Beaver Creek. But he decided to rehab his injured knee and return to the World Cup caravan. He went ahead with his plan, but another fall prevented him from completing it. This time in Kitzbühel. Although it was ""only"" a concussion, and fortunately the ligaments and bones remained intact, it was the last one of his career. <p/> Martin Pavčnik, Siol.net <p/> Biggest successes: 2 World Cup ski race wins (Garmisch 2006/07 and Bormio 2009/10) and two more top 3 finishes.

The investment consists of the redevelopment of the Cash & Carry store, worth 46,498,883 tolars, and the investment in the store equipment is 19,500,000 tolars. As we have assessed that no significant structural interventions are necessary in the existing building, only the partition walls between the supporting columns have been partially demolished in order to improve the visibility of the store. The Hura! discount store measures 1,035 m2, of which the sales area is 656 m2 and the rest consists of a warehouse, two cold stores, two cloakrooms, toilets, corridors and technical rooms. <p/> 50 parking spaces will be available for customers. <p/> The shop's opening hours will be from 8.00 to 20.00 Monday to Friday, from 8.00 to 17.00 on Saturdays and from 8.00 to 12.00 on Sundays in December. <p/> The following day, 16 December, the Hura! discount store will open its doors in Cerknica at 25 Cesta 4. maja.The investment in the Hura! discount store in Cerknica represents the redevelopment of the Mercator supermarket on the ground floor of the multi-storey building of the UE Cerknica, and its value amounts to 40,411,980 tolars, including equipment. The area of the Hura! discounter is 719 m2, of which 405 m2 is sales area, the rest consists of warehouses, separate changing rooms, toilets for employees, a cleaning room, an office and technical premises. <p/> There are 40 parking spaces in front of the shop. <p/> The shop's opening hours will be from 8.00 to 20.00 Monday to Friday, from 8.00 to 17.00 on Saturdays and from 8.00 to 12.00 on Sundays in December. <p/> Customers will be able to choose from more than 1,100 products from all product groups in both stores, with a larger selection of products in the beverages, basic foods, washing powders and stationery ranges. There will also be products from other product groups, such as packaged fresh meat and meat products, fruit and vegetables, packaged bread and bread products, sweet and savoury products, spices, personal care products, small animals, etc. <p/> Both the Hura! discount in Murska Sobota and the Hura! discount in Cerknica will have two cash registers equipped with a POS system, and customers will be able to pay with cash, debit cards and Mercator vouchers. <p/> The two stores will employ 6 people each, bringing the total number of employees in the Hura! discount chain to 27 since 9 September, when the first Hura! discount store in Ljubljana opened its doors. <p/> With the opening of Hura! discounters, Mercator is following the trends in retail development and, above all, the expectations of customers in the design of sales formats aimed at basic supplies. Market research on attitudes towards hard discounters shows that in all markets where Mercator already operates, a high proportion of customers are in favour of discounters. Based on these findings and the trends in the offer, we have assessed that there is potential for the development of this type of store format. We expect that the expansion of the Hura! discount retail chain in Slovenia in the next few years will lead to a significant market share among discount providers. The guiding principle behind the design of Hura! discounters is to offer customers quality products from lesser-known brands, the main characteristic of which is price competitiveness, while creating as simple, yet comfortable and friendly shopping environment for the customer as possible.",Information/Explanation

The importance of the opponent and the objective of reaching the top of the group again two rounds before the end of this part of the competition makes this match extremely serious and predicts one of the most interesting evenings in European football. <p/> More than a month and a half after their first Champions League match, Real Madrid will play their second match in this competition on home soil.

"Friday 01 August 2008 <p/> This autumn there will be elections to the National Assembly. Therefore, in the first half of June, we sent a questionnaire to the parliamentary parties asking about their attitude towards family policy, the work they have done so far and their plans or promises for the new mandate in this area, as well as their opinion on some concrete proposals of the Family Initiative. We asked the parties to return the questionnaires to us by the end of June. <p/> Only the NSi group sent us a fully completed questionnaire within the deadline. They expressed their support for most of our proposals and listed several solutions they had proposed and implemented during the current mandate. In addition to the more high-profile ones, which you are probably all familiar with, let me mention two less well-known ones, such as the 50 per cent reduction in the contribution for the use of public roads for families with four or more children and the abolition of the administrative fee for marriage. The fact that these are not just words is borne out by the experience of this term, when the NSi Group of Deputies has repeatedly asked us for our opinion or for consultation, and our proposals have been taken on board, at least to some extent. Of course, we would have been even happier if there had been more of this. <p/> The second and so far last questionnaire was sent to us by the LDS. The questionnaire is only partially filled in and considerably less specific. For the most part, they did not really say anything about the specific proposals of the Family Initiative, with the predominant answer being ""it is interesting, needs to be changed, and then maybe worth supporting"", with the feasibility mostly based on the constraints of public finances, and with quite a few of the proposals they also made it clear that they did not support them. Interestingly, despite the fact that they have had the scissors and the canvas for 12 years and that the situation has not deteriorated in recent years (in some areas it has improved), they are very critical of the current state of family policy. <p/> We were also promised a questionnaire by the SLS, but have not received it to date. They have repeatedly shown their support for pro-family solutions in the past and have proposed some of their own. We hope that they will also send us something more concrete as soon as possible. <p/> The SD referred us to their alternative government programme, which is quite interesting reading in some points and also promises some of the solutions that the Family Initiative has been pointing out for quite a number of years. In some areas they advocate completely opposite proposals, and in others the text is quite intangible. Caution in reading it is warranted by past experience, because when the party had significant influence in government for a number of years, there was no real will and no real listening to the same proposals. You can find the programme on the SD website. <p/> Lipa has sent us its statutes and programme, and has promised an electoral programme. The party programme received contains very little that is tangible, and not much space is given to parents and the family. Perhaps the electoral programme will be something more concrete. <p/> Sunday 22 June 2008 <p/> This autumn there will be elections for Members of the European Parliament. A significant part of our electorate are parents, and so their attitudes, plans and work on family policy so far are also important to us when choosing parties and candidates for the parliament. <p/> The Family Initiative, the Association for a Family Friendly Society, is a non-partisan association of parents and friends of families that has been working for the best possible position of families in Slovenian society for 10 years. During this time, several governments have changed and we have held a critical mirror up to all of them, proposing the best possible solutions, opposing the bad ones, praising the good ones... This has certainly been the best demonstration of our professionalism and party independence, which is why our membership has been growing. <p/> Before the 2008 elections, we would like to ask all parliamentary parties about their attitudes to family policy, what they have done in the past (you know, actions count for more than promises) and what they intend to do in the next parliamentary term, if the electorate entrusts you with the leadership of the country. <p/> That's why we have contacted all political parties and asked them to fill in a questionnaire on their attitudes towards family policy. Once we have compiled the results, we will also present them to the public. For those parties that do not respond, we will assume that they are not interested or do not consider this area worthy of attention. <p/>Family Initiative hopes that the questionnaire has been / will be accepted by the parties as an opportunity to present their programme and plans in a concrete way.",Opinion/Argumentation

"Fortune Telling - Tricks Revealed <p/> Man has always been curious about what the future holds. In the past - and still today for some primitive peoples - the future was foretold from the entrails of a sacrificed animal, but today we have a variety of divination techniques at our disposal: the horoscope, the crystal ball, palm or coffee grounds divination, numerology, charts, runes and the list goes on and on. Is it just a good trick or does fortune-telling really predict the future? <p/> "" A sucker is born every minute "" <p/> is a statement attributed to P. T. Barnum, an American entertainer and businessman who was famous for his pranks. The Barnum effect, on which fortune-telling is based, is named after him. It is the idea that a person recognises his own personality traits in common or stereotypical descriptions of personality. He even finds the descriptions incredibly true for him! <p/> Divination is often based on claims that cannot be verified or disputed, e.g. "" You have great potential within you .""; "" You have a need to be liked .""; describes characteristics that are typical of a certain age, gender or status e.g. a fortune teller tells an elderly woman that her hearing is probably deteriorating and she will need a hearing aid predicts events that will happen to each of us sooner or later e.g. "" You will soon receive an interesting phone call ."". The word ""sometimes"" is often used in predictions e.g. "" Sometimes you say what you think clearly, but sometimes you bite your tongue to avoid resentment."" <p/> Divination is more convincing when it involves personal information: name, date of birth, date of marriage, etc. It is also important that divination evokes a sense of magic or special energies, e.g. divination using magic crystals. For example, dressing in magical clothes or in a cloak that reflects negative energy adds a special impression of magic. <p/> The use of unusual or repetitive hand movements, steady strokes or sounds serves to bring the divination into a trance state where the individual is even more receptive to what is being said. <p/> When the prediction comes true <p/> The fortune teller has told us what is in store for us, and then we go out into the world with this knowledge. When we expect something to happen, even completely unrelated and coincidental events can be perceived as connected. For example, a fortune teller tells you: "" You are going to have a car accident because of a flat tyre, you better not drive your car for a while. ""Just in case, you really don't get behind the wheel. A week later, your friend tells you that the last time he had a flat tyre, he narrowly avoided a collision. "" The guessing paid off! Good thing I wasn't driving! "", you utter, relieved that you have perceived two coincidental events as connected. <p/> Fortune-telling skills <p/> Good language skills are important for fortune-telling. A fortune teller speaks clearly, fluently and quickly enough that you cannot hear your own thoughts or reach out to him. At times he makes a claim and waits for your response. If you agree with the claim, he will reinforce it in the future. If you disagree, he will take the conversation in a different direction. Sometimes he will only make part of the claim and it is up to you to complete it as you see fit. <p/> A fortune teller must also be a good observer. He or she needs to recognise what you are communicating through your posture and facial expressions, what your clothes and fashion accessories say about you, your status and your lifestyle. Based on these insights, the fortune teller will be able to choose expressions that are even more suited to you. <p/> Fortune-telling is also helpful to the individual <p/> When fortune-telling predicts pleasant events and the successful achievement of goals, it can have a very motivating effect on the individual. He or she will embark on the journey to achieve his or her goals with confidence, working harder and better, as all his or her energy will be directed towards the goal. <p/> Divination can show a person a new way of looking at a problem and new solutions that they would not have thought of on their own. <p/> Is it possible to predict the future? <p/> So far, no divination has accurately predicted the future - so the claims could be scientifically verified.

"Chronic wrist pain <p/> Chronic wrist pain occurs gradually and is not usually the result of an acute injury. The tendons and tendon sheaths are most commonly affected due to repetitive strain. The most common of these are inflammations of the tendons of the wrist, specifically tendonitis of the extensor tendon of the thumb (Mb. DeQuervain), cysts of the tendon sheaths or the joint capsule, and bursitis in the wrist region. <p/> Wrist fractures due to circulatory disturbances, chronic ligament tears, wrist instability and wear lesions also occur. Tumour lesions are also a possible cause of pain. <p/> Recognise the symptoms <p/> The most common symptom is chronic pain, mostly related to movement or strain. When unstable, the pain intensifies with certain movements in the wrist. <p/> Alarm to see an orthopaedic surgeon <p/> When you experience wrist pain that lasts for several weeks, it is time to see an orthopaedic surgeon. <p/> Path to diagnosis <p/> A clinical examination by an orthopaedic surgeon gives an orientation on the nature of the problem or the affected wrist structures. The basic examination is an X-ray of the wrist in different projections. To clarify the exact situation, an ultrasound or MRI scan of the wrist is performed. In case of suspected instability with wrist ligament tear, additional information is obtained by contrast-enhanced MRI. <p/> Treatment methods <p/> In the case of an inflammatory cause of wrist pain, immobilisation is recommended for a short period. Physical therapy initially includes anti-inflammatory irradiation with high energy laser (HIL), and super magnetotherapy (SIS). This is followed by individual exercises to stretch and flex the tendons. <p/> Minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery is also an option for early degenerative processes. <p/> In cases of instability, wrist bone failure due to circulatory disorders or other more complex conditions following injury, more complex surgical interventions may be considered.",Information/Explanation

"MIHA ŠALEHAR: 'We live in a brainwashed age' <p/> Miha Šalehar is definitely one of those people with whom you can easily get into an hour-long debate over a beer. But as it was a bit early on a Tuesday morning for such a thing, coffee was more than a suitable substance. Especially for a discussion about books, music, mass dehumanisation and more. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Given the nature of your shows and articles, the first question seems more than appropriate: who is Miha Šalehar anyway? <p/> Miha Šalehar: Yes, Miha Šalehar. Really, thank you for asking me the hardest question right from the start (laughs). Let me think. I am definitely not the same person for my home and for my listeners or readers. As far as sentiments are concerned, I think sometimes I get on everybody's nerves, and other times I am amusing to them. Sometimes they don't understand me very well. Let's just say that is my red thread. <p/> ROCKER.SI: With the arrival of autumn, new seasons of all kinds of reality shows will start or have started on TV. Along with them, there will be scandals and things like that, which you often deal with in your articles. I assume you have already accumulated some material over the summer? <p/> Miha Šalehar: If you mean the show Latrina, it's still on hiatus for once, but that may change soon. Personally, I don't watch reality shows very often, make no mistake. But my friends have been sending me all sorts of stuff from the domestic scene, and I've accumulated a lot of material in the meantime (laughs). <p/> But it slowly dawns on me that everything, our lives in general, have become one big reality show. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Let's stop a little bit with Babewatch, which you and your brother Matevž formed in the late 1990s. How do you look back on those days, almost twenty years later? <p/> Miha Šalehar: It was definitely a wonderful time. Because the best thing is to be a mule, to have a garage with an old beer fridge and to play rock 'n' roll with your own band. But I'm also glad that I left those waters and that those times have become just a pleasant memory of my youth. <p/> Miha Šalehar: No, to be revived, someone has to miss you first. Guns [Guns N' Roses] were missed. They miss Floyd [Pink Floyd] and R.E.M, but not Babewatch, please. Apart from two obscure fans from Primorska, nobody misses us. We were kids, we had a good time, the rest is history. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Let's touch on your recently published collection of columns called The Spirit of Something. Where did the idea for such a venture come from? <p/> Miha Šalehar: The idea didn't come from me at all, but from the editor Nina Žitko Pucer. To be quite honest, I thought it was a very lame idea at first. Who is going to read this? The columns are a thing that is published for the sake of weekly reading. And I have never read a collection of columns myself. <p/> We were very surprised by the sales results. I think we are now on our third reprint, which is really incredible. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Would you say that Slovenians are good readers? <p/> Miha Šalehar: I would rather say that we Slovenians read the wrong things. It's not the fact that I'm a good writer that has contributed to the sales results, but the fact that I appear on the radio every week. <p/> I wouldn't say that Slovenians are good readers if they read me (laughs). <p/> I'm afraid of the fact that it's easier to sell 3000 copies of books nowadays than 500 copies of studio records. On the other hand, it makes me happy that people are still willing to read one author, even me, in such large numbers. So that I don't just spit on myself and my readers (laughs). <p/> ROCKER.SI: Was there any negative reaction to the book's publication? <p/> Miha Šalehar: Of course, there's never a shortage of that. Although I'm quite lucky around that myself. I think most people understand that I try to be honest and fair in my work, which is why there hasn't been much criticism. It is also true that I am sometimes abusive in that, but that has nothing to do with honesty itself. <p/> However, some criticism was published before the actual publication of the book. These seem to me to be the most relevant. If you are a public figure, which by the definition of my profession I am, criticism is to be expected. It's perfectly normal to swallow a good truckload (or more) of shit on your own account over the years. Especially because of the seemingly democratic society we live in, where any c*ck* can write whatever they want under a pseudonym. The content of online comments has become juicier than signed copyright stuff. It is the sort of thing that I would take the greatest pleasure in shutting down. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Something along the lines of Oscar Wilde, give a man a mask and he'll tell you the ""truth""? <p/> Miha Šalehar: Sort of, but I'm afraid that people in masks are not acting in the service of actual truth. If you want to see who is creating our reality, read the online comments. It's really, really scary stuff. <p/>What has caused us to become such hateful primitives, I have no idea. But I console myself that it is very likely just a handful of individuals who are roleplaying the topics mentioned. How is it possible that we are falling for them? <p/>I find it hard to imagine that 90% of people are idiots. Of course they are not, at least I hope not. It is a very small minority, less than 1%. How do they manage to have so much influence? <p/> ROCKER.SI: Does that sound like an idea for a book? <p/> Miha Šalehar: Not at all. This book concludes my oeuvre where I have explored the existence of a non-existent middle class. Starting with education and religion, where we are told who we are and what our world should be like. <p/> The book is not a stand-alone publication, but goes hand in hand with my work on the radio. <p/> The opus is coming to an end, because I am beginning to be interested in other things. <p/> ROCKER.SI: Where can our readers buy your book? <p/> Miha Šalehar: In all Mladinska knjiga bookshops. The network is very wide. They can meet me in person at the upcoming Slovenian Book Fair, where I will be present on Wednesday. I will be happy to chat with you and sign some books for you. <p/> Miha Šalehar: I always have a problem with that, because I don't want to appear patronising (laughs). <p/> Don't be fooled by everything you hear or read, it's one big scam. Be totally sceptical. It seems to me that we live in a dictatorship of media fear and marketing solutions that are offered to us by the advertising apparatus five minutes after the media have published the next series of horrors. <p/> We live in a brainwashed age, because we are all brainwashed.

"Ombudsman <p/> ČP <p/> Consistency in responding and length of inspection procedures also at local level remains a problem <p/> The Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia found that the Inter-municipal Inspectorate of the Joint Municipal Administration - 5G violated the principle of good administration by failing to respond to the petitioner, who had submitted several reports to it, in accordance with Article 17 of the Regulation on Administrative Operations, and by inexplicably failing to follow up on the petitioner's request for a tailored method of communication. The inspection of the petitioner's first complaint was carried out one day before the reply of the Inter-municipal Inspectorate to the Ombudsman and almost 11 months after the complaint, which the Ombudsman considers to be an unacceptable length of time. Both the inspection procedure concerning the petitioner's first and second complaint are still pending. <p/> * * * * <p/> The Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia (the Ombudsman) dealt with the petitioner's petition concerning the alleged pollution of her property with various sewage and waste. The petitioner informed the Ombudsman that she addressed her letters and complaints to, inter alia, the Municipality of Škofljica (the Municipality) and the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate and Redarstvo of the Municipalities of Grosuplje, Ig and Škofljica (the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate).The tasks of the Inter-Munial Inspectorate were in the meantime taken over by the Joint Municipal Administration 5G, within which the current Inter-Munial Inspectorate operates. <p/> The Ombudsman has not found any irregularities in the conduct of the Municipality, which received the petitioner's communication for information only and therefore did not respond to it. <p/> According to the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate, it received the petitioner's complaint on 24 June 2019 regarding the pollution of her property with waste water allegedly caused by the owners of neighbouring properties, and an inspection was to be carried out on 22 June 2020, but it has not yet informed the petitioner of its findings pursuant to Article 24 of the Inspection Control Act (ICA). He is expected to do so at the end of the procedure, which leads the Ombudsman to conclude that the inspection procedure has not yet been completed. <p/> In the past year, the petitioner submitted two reports to the Inter-municipal Inspectorate. The first report, concerning construction waste dumped on her property, was received by the Inter-Municipal Inspectorate from the Ljubljana-Vič Police Station on 19 May 2020. The Inter-Municipal Inspectorate referred this report to the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for the Environment and Spatial Planning (IRSOP), which informed the petitioner and the Ombudsman. A second complaint by the petitioner concerning the alteration of nature trails was received by the Inter-municipal Inspectorate on 27 May 2020 and referred to the IRSOP. An inspection has not yet been carried out in this respect. <p/> Taking into account all available documentation, the Ombudsman found that the inspection of the petitioner's first complaint was carried out one day before the Inter-municipal Inspectorate's reply to the Ombudsman and almost 11 months after the complaint, which we considered to be unacceptably late. We pointed out to the Inter-municipal Inspectorate that, while it is true that, in accordance with Article 4 of the CPC, inspectors are independent in carrying out inspection tasks within the scope of their powers and that inspection procedures are (primarily) procedures in the public interest, this does not in itself justify significant delays such as those experienced in the specific case. We have also clarified that Article 24 of the CPC does not constitute an obstacle to the inspector informing the notifier of his actions at an earlier stage in the light of the principle of good administration, nor does it relieve the inspector of his obligation based on the provision of the first proviso to Article 17(1) of the CPC to inform the notifier of his actions at an earlier stage. The Inspector is not under any obligation under Article 17 of the Administrative Procedure Regulation (APR), according to which the authority is obliged to reply to all correspondence from which it can be inferred that the authority expects a reply and the identity of the sender, unless the content of the correspondence relates to a procedure pending before the authority, the correspondence is vexatious, or the authority has already replied to the sender on a substantially similar issue. The Authority is obliged to reply, in accordance with the second paragraph of that Article, no later than 15 days after receipt of the document, to the address indicated in the letter. On the basis of the reply received from the Inter-municipal Inspectorate, we conclude that the petitioner did not receive such a notification. In addition to the above, the Ombudsman also noted that, although the Inter-municipal Inspectorate had informed the petitioner of its decision to withdraw the notification to the IRSOP, it had not followed her request for an adapted method of communication. After further enquiries by the Ombudsman, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate agreed that, in accordance with the UUP, it should have dealt with the cases as quickly as possible and replied to all correspondence within 15 days. However, in his opinion, this is not always possible, mainly due to the large number of reports received, the work priorities, as well as the prolonged sick leave. He stressed that the risk assessment, the public interest and the nature of the infringement must be taken into account when dealing with reports, the conduct of inspection procedures and the criteria for setting priorities, and was aware that this was not a sufficient justification. As regards the follow-up of the procedure, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate stated that it had been in contact with the petitioner by telephone and that a joint field visit would be carried out as soon as possible in the light of the petitioner's possibilities. <p/> The Ombudsman considered the response of the Inter-municipal Inspectorate, assuming the veracity of its allegations, to be adequate, but at the same time expressed doubts that a positive development in the specific case would have taken place even without its intervention. The Ombudsman has been drawing attention to the lengthy nature of inspection procedures at both national and local level for many years, but unfortunately, despite the Ombudsman's repeated appeals, progress cannot be assessed as satisfactory. In any case, the large number of cases handled by the average inspector cannot be ignored, taking into account the already chronic staff shortage in all inspectorates. This does not, of course, in itself justify the lengthy decision-making process in this case and in many others. <p/> In conclusion, the Ombudsman expressed the expectation that, taking into account all the relevant circumstances, the Inter-municipal Inspectorate would conclude both inspection proceedings within a reasonable time and that it would inform the petitioner of its findings in a manner that would be appropriate for her, at the latest at the end of the proceedings. The Ombudsman considers the present petition to be well-founded and has found a breach of the principle of good administration.",Legal/Regulation

"@ PJ. I will briefly repeat my reply to your comment: congratulations and good health to you in the future. I wonder if you have written down the diagnosis "" lame from the waist down "", and the cure somewhere. Do you keep this knowledge you have gained to yourself or are you interested in sharing it with someone else who is dealing with a similar intractable problem. <p/> For me it is a little different. A very aggressive form of cancer with a very poor prognosis (in terms of percentage cured) was contracted by a family member. Unexpectedly, while she was waiting for surgery, I gave her a month of therapy using the procedure or technique carried out by Zdenko Domančič and his team. For 30 days, 2x a day. I did the therapies exclusively at her request, it is difficult to explain how this came about. On the third day her condition started to improve. She was able to start walking up stairs again, she hadn't been able to do it before, she had a cold all winter, she had difficulty breathing, sinus problems, chronically blocked nose, she hadn't smelled for a year. No antibiotic was helping her effectively anymore. In the meantime, while she was waiting for the operation (she had to undergo a few more tests), she was not receiving any medication to treat her cancer. When she was operated on, it was found that, of the five tumours, four had disappeared and one had gone from 15 mm to about 5 mm. I admit that I am not foolish and I do not know what we managed in the long run. Time will tell. I am still continuing with the therapies, following the advice of the people in the bioenergetician's circle. <p/> That is why I was interested in your description of the effect of the energy flow on the diseased tissue. <p/> @David: as I have said before, and I feel you are realising yourself, vanity can be a problem here and difficult to overcome. So I will just say this: the conclusion is that you are on the right path. It might be worth familiarising yourself with the content on stimulating the pituitary gland. <p/> @david: I do not know if we have understood each other correctly. I can imagine what it is like for you in the situation you are in ... We too were diagnosed with cancer three years ago with the youngest in the family. Unfortunately, at that time I was not yet aware of the therapy that was being researched in the 1960s and was supposedly achieving excellent results. <p/> As I said, it was roughly about (electromagnetic) stimulation of the pituitary gland. This resulted in the formation of bodies that fed on the malignant cells, which reduced the tumour. At the same time, the inhibitors, in turn, inhibited the development or proliferation of stem cells into malignant cells... <p/>I'm sorry I didn't go into the details, but if I had another chance, I would have. We said goodbye to the youngest in our family a year ago. I suspect, however, that what you are describing is exactly this model of treatment. <p/>David, now a word of caution: P.J. obviously brings spices that the dish does not need to tickle you in the first place, and then writes about inferring that it is a crowd that is supposed to be on the right path. This makes you an information broker for others and no longer just for yourself (different levels of responsibility, after all...). <p/> I did not follow your dialogue and I have no idea what it is about ... but I am naturally cautious about similar transitions from singular to plural. <p/> Ah, that post cut off part of the communication - but as far as I'm concerned, it's still the case that a person should give partly different information on his/her own behalf than if he/she gives it on behalf of a group (even if it's the same joint project of whatever). <p/> @ niko: thanks for the warning. It should have used a colon. I'm sprinkling myself with ashes for that mistake. <p/> As for responsibility, I have to agree with you. In caring for the patient, we (each individual who accepts this role - not to get bogged down with interpretation again) are about to take (again, each individual) full (co-) responsibility for the outcome. <p/> P.S.: Perhaps a clarification on why the change from singular to plural (or, as written, more correctly - dual). <p/> In most treatments there is a patient and a therapist. The course of treatment and cure also depends on the patient and not only on the therapist. Hence the sentence that both of you (all involved), judging by the results described, are (are) on the right path. <p/>@PJ. Now I understand. I can see that you have had quite a few difficult ordeals. Actually, this technique that I am using is the work of Zdenek Domančič. Personally, I think that this therapy has a holistic effect on the patient's immune system (I have seen it myself in several patients after only a few days) and that the body may (or may not, depending of course on the patient's condition) react positively and fight the condition more easily. Although the very act of laying on of hands makes the cancer cells feel unwell. Anyway, if you are interested in more, go to youtube and type in the name of the bioenergetician mentioned, there is a lot said there and research has also been done at various institutions around Slovenia (jozef stefan, I think also at the oncoloske) ... <p/> @Niko, thank you for your concern, but I no longer worry about being unfairly grouped somewhere or thrown in some trash can. I've been called everything from a janissist, to a right-winger, to a pro-Russia, left-winger, and so on, on blogs <p/> @Niko, I don't resent anyone. We're all just human, which is why blog-level resentment is absurdly fucking ridiculous. Which ends up being cruel when someone keeps slandering and moderating you. And yet absurd if the cause is ""virtual"" <p/> I'm not saying I don't resent things too, I do, but it has to be related to a greater amount of money, time, and consequently unattained planned goals. <p/> Man, you weren't disciplining anyone - you were just defending yourself. There was no talk of overstepping the bounds of power. , <p/> There is a note somewhere here among the older posts about how it came about that I put Dajana in spam (etting) and she no longer has access to this blog - the only one and it really wasn't my intention to oppress anyone in such a way, but with her all the normal solutions fall away (the woman is polluting all over the place for absolutely no reason). She only understands that one step too far towards the abyss. <p/> I forgot to leave this link here, under this heading, which was the trigger for the end-to-end, over-amplified and predictable clichéd parroting with the noticeable manifestations of dementia of the blogger Dajana and of the gentleman who has sovereign mastery of the knowledge and functioning of the egos of bitches, Mr Ervinatro. <p/> For your amusement, nobody has given me as much publicity as these two have done on the siol! <p/> werner, you must be very young, I can tell by your naive euphoric conclusions, hehe ... <p/> but I find this strange: in all the American films, the Russians are Americans - well, sometimes Yugos In no time at all, all the ""Russians"" speak English <p/> and then they make the film in such a way that the Russians are made to look like cowards. ------- similarly with the commentators on the net ... ........................ . hint: for me, the ""smart"" person is the one who gives me money and pays me for it - all the others are ballast that I shake off <p/> You don't know, but my teachers know that there is so much of what I do in me - purely from within, without reading, imitating or going anywhere to get knowledge ... , I just like to go and test what is in me.
