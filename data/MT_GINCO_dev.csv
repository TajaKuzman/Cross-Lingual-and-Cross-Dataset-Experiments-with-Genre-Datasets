"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are usually transmitted through sexual contact. <p/> Formerly known as venereal diseases (syphilis, gonorrhoea, soft chancre and inguinal lymphogranuloma), STDs are now commonly divided according to the agents that cause them. <p/> General protection against STDs is abstinence, fidelity to two uninfected partners, or the use of barrier contraceptives, the best known of which is the condom. There is also a female version of the condom called femidon, but it is practically impossible to buy in Slovenia. <p/> The condom is the only contraceptive that both protects against the transmission of sexually transmitted pathogens and prevents unwanted pregnancy. <p/> The most common sexual infections are fungal and bacterial infections, which most often present in women as vaginal discharge, genital itching, burning pain when urinating. However, many sexually transmitted infections occur without any signs of infection or disease problems (asymptomatic infections). <p/> The possibility of infection should always be kept in mind when having sex. If sex is based on a good knowledge of the partner and mutual trust and fidelity, there is no risk of fresh infection. Of course, the risk is much higher with frequent changes of sexual partners and fleeting sexual contacts (promiscuous sexual behaviour). <p/> Some STIs are briefly described below, while HIV/AIDS, chlamydial infections and hepatitis are covered separately. <p/> Gonorrhoea (also gonorrhoea, thrips) Gonorrhoea is a widespread STD caused by gonococcus. It has seemingly, but unjustifiably, lost its importance due to the success and short duration of treatment. There is no data on the actual prevalence of gonorrhoea for Slovenia because the notification, which is compulsory, is incomplete. <p/> Gonorrhoea is sexually transmitted and mainly affects the genital organs. However, there is also gonorrhoea of the conjunctiva of newborn infants, which is contracted during childbirth if the parturient has gonorrhoea. Therefore, to prevent this type of infection, it is obligatory to protect every newborn with so-called Crede's drops at birth. It is also possible for gonococci to infect other sites outside the genitals and genital tract (buttocks, throat). In the male, after a short incubation period of a few days (i.e. the time between infection and the outbreak of the disease), a discharge from the urethra occurs, accompanied by itching and burning pain when urinating. After about 2 weeks, the acute inflammation becomes chronic. Complications of untreated gonorrhoea in a man include inflammation of the prostate, perimenopause and infertility. <p/> In women, there is virtually no disease in the initial period. There are no early signs of possible infection. <p/> Infection progresses to the internal reproductive organs (uterus, fallopian tubes), which can lead to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. <p/> Syphilis Syphilis is a contagious STD that can affect all organs of the human body. The causative agent of syphilis is a bacterium, Treponema pallidum. More than 95 infections are caused by having sex with an infected person. Non-sexual infections are caused by kissing, biting and other contact with a patient who has skin sores. <p/> Data on the prevalence of syphilis are fairly accurate, as the disease was considered the most severe STD due to its consequences until the emergence of HIV infection. In Slovenia, a dramatic increase in syphilis was recorded in 1994 and 1995 (36-38 per year), with a slight decline in the number of new cases in the following years. <p/> Syphilis is divided into early and late (duration up to 1 year or more than 1 year), and acquired and congenital, depending on how the infection occurred. <p/> The incubation period for syphilis is about 3 weeks. <p/> Early syphilis At the site of penetration of the bacterium into the skin or mucous membranes, a hard, hard-edged, round or oval ulcer forms after three days. The ulcer is most often on the genitals, but can also be on the lips or in the oral cavity. After a few days, the lymph nodes in the area swell, and after 2 months, most of the lymph nodes swell. Later, an itchy rash spreading from the trunk to the extremities appears, which spontaneously disappears after 1 to 2 months, leaving whitish patches. Several months after infection, hair loss may occur with coin-sized bald patches that grow back on their own. <p/> Late syphilis In this form, there are not necessarily changes in the skin, but there are changes in the blood vessels and central nervous system. The disease is proven and later controlled by detecting antibodies in the patient's blood or cerebrospinal fluid. <p/> Congenital syphilis A syphilitic infection in the mother can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, or a child may be born with signs of syphilis. The last case of congenital syphilis in Slovenia was reported in 1986. <p/> It is important to detect syphilis as early as possible to prevent the spread of infection and to increase the success of treatment. The drug of choice is still penicillin. <p/> INFECTIONS WITH PAPILLOMA VIRUSES-GENITAL WARTS Some of the viruses belonging to the papillomavirus group cause genital warts (HPV 6 and HPV 11). The incubation period can be several months. The lesions themselves are harmless (benign), but they are very disturbing, uncomfortable, the treatment is long and painful, and recurrences are frequent. <p/> GENITAL HERPES Infection with herpes simplex type 2 is classified as an STD. The infection causes the formation of tiny vesicles on and around the genital area, which later become purulent. The vesicles appear in the presence of various triggering factors (immunosuppression, stress, illness, menstruation). <p/> Initially, there are only bubbles, but later small sores appear. <p/> Infection with the virus is permanent. If a pregnant woman who has a fresh infection gives birth to a child, she may be at high risk. If symptoms are present at the time of delivery, a caesarean section is performed to prevent infection of the newborn. <p/> Treatment of skin lesions is symptomatic. However, there are antiviral drugs that prevent the appearance of vesicles in people with a high incidence of genital herpes. These medicines are prescribed by a doctor. <p/> FUNGAL INFECTIONS Fungal infections of the genital tract are most commonly caused by fungi of the genus Candida, which are present in small numbers on mucous membranes. They often multiply on the mucous membranes of the female genital mucosa and are passed on during sexual intercourse. Men usually do not have problems, but may develop burning, reddish, partly whitish, penile rashes. <p/> In women, the genital area usually itches, the mucous membrane is red and there is a white, cheesy vaginal discharge. <p/> Creams and vaginal tablets are used for treatment. <p/> Pubic lice Pubic lice live on the hair of the genitals and are transmitted by sexual contact. Lice and nits are found on the hairs. Severe itching occurs. All infected persons must be treated and bed linen must be properly hygienised (wash at 95 degrees C). <p/> CHLAMIDIA INFECTIONS Data on the prevalence of chlamydia infections in Slovenia are unreliable. Despite the fact that it is compulsory to report the infection and that chlamydial infections are among the most common STDs, reporting is not practiced. Chlamydia are very small bacteria, sexually transmitted by Chlamydia trachomatis. <p/> In men, urethral and later perineal inflammation occurs after about 14 days after infection. However, an infected male may be without problems. <p/> Newborn babies become infected at birth if their mother has chlamydia cervicitis. Chlamydia eye inflammation and/or chlamydial pneumonia develop. <p/> The infection is treated with antibiotics. <p/> TRYHOMONIAZA Infection is caused by a protozoan, Trichomonas vaginalis. <p/> In men there is usually no problem, rarely there is inflammation of the urethral orifice and burning pain on urination. In women, after incubation for a few days, a foul-smelling, foamy vaginal discharge appears, accompanied by itching of the external genitalia and pain on urination.",Information/Explanation

"I am the mother of 21-month-old Rene, a very lively and persistent boy who loves to play football whenever and wherever possible. He is very playful, sociable, smiley, puts even the most serious and sad people in a good mood and captivates everyone who sees the sparkle in his eyes. Rene was born with a congenital deformity of the right leg called fibular hemimelia - a lack of the fibula bone that holds the foot and knee in the correct position. I found out about the deformity when I was pregnant, as I was regularly monitored in Ljubljana due to the loss of two children in previous pregnancies. Given the bad experiences I had had before, I was prepared for the worst-case scenarios, which fortunately did not materialise and Rene is otherwise perfectly healthy and without any other problems. At the moment we are solving the height difference with the help of adapted shoes and orthosis, which are regularly custom-made at the URI Soča in LJ, but this has become increasingly difficult since sometime in the new year, as the leg has become quite bent in the foot and knee due to the increased load. The doctor expects that walking with such a leg will soon be impossible and that Rene will end up in a wheelchair, and advises early surgical treatment. At the Orthopaedic Clinic in Ljubljana, where we have been treated since birth, they suggested amputation of the leg as the only possible solution. I got myself active online and on FB and got in touch with Dr Dror Paley, a doctor from the USA who has his own clinic in Florida. He has been dealing with fibular haemimelia for 30 years and has successfully operated on more than 200 such children. We visited him at the beginning of April and he promised us a full recovery. It takes 3 operations, which are recommended to be done at the age of 2 years, which together with rehabilitation and surgery to remove the fixator cost 180.000. There is a possibility of an operation in Milan and a follow-up in Florida, which would bring the total amount down a little. The date he proposed us is 20.6.2014. As Dr. Paley is only in Italy 1 x a year, we decided to try in every possible way to raise the necessary funds and catch the opportunity. I immediately submitted an application to the Health Insurance Fund, but the process is quite lengthy and, according to the experience of parents with similar problems, most of the time only partially approved, if at all. Therefore, I would like to ask everyone who has been touched by our story and would like to help Rene to continue to walk and play football, to donate any amount to his TRR SI 56 2900 0003 2052 246 at UniCredit Banka Slovenija d.d., Rene Muhamed Talić, Martinuči 2, 5292 Renče.

"info@dc-dlan.si <p/> 0590 80 616 <p/> CONTACT US <p/> What does gender theory teach? <p/> Gender theory is the latest ideology to emerge from the social sciences. <p/> At its core, it denies the existence of two natural identities (male identity and female identity), denies the differences between them and denies the natural attraction between male and female. (Proponents of gender theory argue that heterosexuality is a ""compulsion"" of society that dictates that sexual relations must be between two different sexes and, consequently, procreative). <p/> Gender theory primarily teaches that a person's gender is not determined by his or her genitals, but that the individual decides for him or herself what gender he or she will be. Thus, the ""true sex"" is only that which the individual feels in his or her mind. This realisation has given rise to a wide range of genders that is difficult to match. Not only can an individual change his or her gender, but he or she can also switch between them, invent a new gender or decide to be genderless or asexual. <p/> At the same time, gender theory does not recognise that the relationship between man and woman is unique. It claims that all sexual orientations and practices are the same. Thus, there is no difference between heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, asexuality or any other sexual experience or experience. <p/> Why is gender theory an ideology? Gender theory is not a scientific theory because it is completely divorced from the natural sciences. It also does not have a single author, but has been developed piecemeal over more than 60 years. It began to develop in the 1950s (through the Marxist feminist Simone de Beavuor) and then in the 1970s in the USA through the Women's Revolution, which coincided with the sexual revolution. In the 1990s it was radicalised by the feminist Judith Butler (and her followers), who still argues that gender identity is an illusion. According to her, even biological bodies are not a natural given, but shaped by culture, by society. <p/> Why did it all start with feminists? They were convinced that talking about masculinity and femininity and their differences leads to even more stereotypical thinking and to a deepening of masculine and feminine gender schemas, the result of which is the perpetuation of women's subordinate social position. <p/> Gender theory reached its global peak in 1995, when the UN adopted the new term 'gender' at the World Conference on Women in Beijing, thereby signaling that gender would no longer be spoken of as a stable natural given (biological sex) but as a merely unstable and fluid category (social sex) that has no pre-given essence or meaning. Today, gender identity is seen only as a deep inner sense of belonging to a gender that may or may not correspond to one's innate sex. <p/> This policy was launched by the UN 20 years ago and has infiltrated every pore of society: politics, the judiciary, the media, philanthropic and humanitarian organisations, schools and universities, music, art, film and literature. <p/> The various LGBT lobbies and influential NGOs in the main European institutions (ILGA at the European Commission and others) have played a major role in this revolution. <p/> When did the ideology start? <p/> Robert Stoller (1925-1992) of the University of California, Los Angeles, was the first to divide sexual identity into biological sex (sex) and social sex (gender). Humans are therefore defined by two dimensions: biology (chromosomes, hormones, external and internal sex organs, secondary sex characteristics) and the social-psychological expression of gender (sex roles, behaviour, actions, traits). <p/> The distinction between biological and social sex is not in itself false. It becomes ideological when social gender is assigned a dominant role in determining gender identity. <p/> Gender ideology began when theorists isolated biological sex from social sex. This separation made the two categories completely unrelated, without the influence of one on the other. <p/> The truth is that biological and social sex are interdependent, complementary and intimately linked within the developmental process. We cannot imagine a body that does not have a direct influence on the development of psychological sex and that is not reflected in concrete ways in society. From this point of view, social gender is not, under any circumstances, simply determined by society or ""taught"" from the outside. <p/> Science in the 1950s and gender theory <p/> Dr Money, who was a psychologist and sexologist, was developing a new theory of gender around 1970. His idea was based on the premise that a newborn baby is born psychosexually neutral and that by the age of three, it can be assigned either a male or a female sex. So, it is only parents and society that mould children into men and women. The biological component of sex - chromosomes, gonads, hormones, external and internal sex organs - is merely a kind of ""plastic"" that can be either overlooked (chromosomes) or altered at will. <p/> Dr Money, who was head of the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic, and his colleagues did not see the human being as a whole, whose psyche and physicality develop mutually, from conception onwards. The inextricable link between endocrinology and brain development and their influence on the development of the individual's psyche and behaviour was not a topic they wanted to explore. He preferred to calculate human components in his own way, believing that the psyche would adapt to newly imposed chemical and surgical changes if only education was persistent enough. <p/> A sad combination of circumstances brought a boy of less than two years of age to Moneye's practice, who at eight months was left without a sex organ after an accident. Dr Money, through prior indoctrination of his parents, had raised him as a girl. What has become apparent over the years has had a catastrophic effect on the psychosocial development of this boy and on his entire family. But since no one but the immediate family saw this, Dr Money used this case in books and professional articles as a successful example of the proof that biology is changeable and that nurture plays a key role in the formation of sexual identity. <p/> The growing women's movement in the USA, which had been fighting for decades against the biological basis of gender differences, saw in Money's theory a scientific explanation that the differences between men and women were the result of social expectations that had been shaped by a patriarchal pattern. <p/> Moneyev's theory and the feminist movement have virtually merged into one: man and woman are basically identical, having been born ""neutral"". All the visible differences between them (their gait, posture, tastes, interests, hobbies, the way they dress, speak, feel, relate; children's choice of games and toys, adults' choice of occupation, their roles in society and the family, etc.) are merely a matter of habituation, which can be overcome by a persistent revolutionary movement and through re-education. <p/> That Moneyev's theory does not hold water and that the Decalogue has been falsely presented as scientific was exposed in 1995 by Dr Milton Diamond. Investigative journalist, David Colapinto, wrote a high-profile article on the case in Rolling Stone magazine in 1997 and the world-famous bestseller Bruce, Brenda, David in 2000. The boy who was raised as a girl. <p/>What do scientists say today? <p/> Johns Hopkins Hospital, famous in the 1970s for its state-of-the-art sex theory, took a different course after Moneye's gradual withdrawal. After the arrival of Dr McHugh, an advocate of bringing sanity back into the profession, the Gender Identity Clinic, which had been surgically altering the sex of adult human beings, was closed down as early as 1979. <p/> Last August 2016, Dr McHugh, in collaboration with Dr Mayer, published the largest study in the field of sexuality and gender identity in the scientific journal The New Atlantis. Together, they worked on over 500 studies published from 1950 to the present day. They have taken a hard look at all the factors that have a major impact on the development of a person's sexual orientation and gender identity. They have paid a great deal of attention to mental health and the real difficulties experienced by non-heterosexual people and people who have problems with their sexual identity. <p/> With regard to sexual identity, they simply confirmed the fact that it cannot be independent of biological sex. Among all the studies examined, they found no scientific evidence to confirm that there is a physiological cause that determines a person's feeling of having been born in the wrong body. <p/> Furthermore, they found that adults who have undergone sex reassignment surgery continue to suffer from poor mental health. The scientists also found that so-called social stressors (discrimination, prejudice, stigmatisation) were not the main source of suffering, leading these people to experience fear, anxiety, isolation, alcoholism, drug abuse and suicidality (41%). Above all, they found that these are the ills that stem to the greatest extent from the person himself, from the conflict that he carries within himself. <p/> They also looked critically at attempts at sex reassignment in children. They have observed that a very small number of children who are overwhelmed by the feeling of being trapped in the wrong body when they are growing up will continue to have this opinion of themselves after they have grown up. For this reason, there is no evidence that children who exhibit atypical behaviour during puberty should be encouraged to undergo hormonal and surgical sex reassignment. <p/> Poor psychological health continues to be associated with people who suffer from discomfort in accepting their own bodies, and both doctors are working hard to help these patients in the best possible way. <p/> Gender theory in the school system <p/> Gender theory is already part of the regular curriculum in many countries. In Slovenia, the advocates of gender theory have also ensured that for more than a decade now, Slovenian public schools have also offered programmes called ""against homophobia"", ""against stereotypes"", ""against discrimination"", ""for inclusion of all"", ""for human rights"", etc. They are carried out in our country by various associations such as Amnesty International, the DiH Association, the Peace Institute, Legebitra, the TransAkcija Association, etc. <p/> Through debates, brochures, magazines and games, children are taught that there are several genders, that everyone has the right to determine their own gender and to experiment with their sexual orientation. <p/> Example: a few years ago, Amnesty International published the book Love is Love and disseminated its content in Slovenian primary and secondary schools. I quote a few sentences from the book, which show that it denigrates the traditional family, the role of dad and mum in bringing up children, promotes homosexuality and creates a great deal of confusion about sexual identity. <p/> ""Is the father figure always male?"" (p. 20) <p/> ""Is the mother figure something that is essentially tied to the female gender?"" (p.20) <p/> ""Let us remember that gender is something that we must have the right and the possibility to create ourselves and not according to the dictates of our genitals, which should force a person to be a woman or to be a man!"" (p.26) <p/> ""Being lesbian or gay, bisexual or transgender, intersex is normal and totally cool."" (p.39) <p/> Primary school children read books like ""My name is Damjan"" (about a girl who wants to be a boy), ""And with Tango there are three of us"" (about two penguins who get a daughter named Tango), etc. <p/> Changing the language of legislation <p/> ""Change the words and you will change the way society thinks"", wrote Lenin. Language became the main tool for achieving cultural change. Words like 'family', 'marriage', 'love', 'sex' take on a new, different, polysemous meaning; the words 'natural', 'normal', 'perverse' are removed. In certain countries (e.g. Switzerland, the canton of Bern), words with a more neutral sound have been introduced. <p/> The words ""father and mother"" and ""husband and wife"" are the most affected. They are taking away gender from these terms because they are convinced that society must not produce the herosexual family as the only example of a family. They therefore prefer to choose neutral terms where no one will be discriminated against and where all the symbolism of natural family ties will be erased and consequently irrelevant. <p/> Instead of ""father and mother"": <p/> ""parent 1"" and ""parent 2"" (Spain) <p/> ""genetic donor"" (Quebec Civil Code) <p/> Instead of ""husband and wife"" <p/> ""person 1"" and ""person 2"" (proposal for Slovenia, 2015)",Opinion/Argumentation

"Sports hall completed <p/> After twenty-five years of work, a new multi-purpose sports hall has been completed in Mengeš, which will be used by schoolchildren in the morning and by associations and other citizens in the afternoon and evening. It will be handed over on 1 October. <p/> The hall cost €4.5 million and Mengeš also obtained a grant for the investment. <p/> Mengeš - The multi-purpose sports hall, located next to the Mengeš Primary School, is almost complete after a year since the foundation stone was laid last June. These days, workers are sanding and varnishing the parquet flooring, while minor landscaping work is being carried out on the external areas. <p/> According to the Director of the Mengeš Municipal Administration, Urban Kolar, a technical inspection will be carried out on Thursday and the hall will be handed over on 1 October. <p/> The hall, together with the outdoor playgrounds and the athletics track with tartan and climbing wall inside, will primarily be used for sports lessons and other leisure activities of the Mengeš Primary School, but other local associations and citizens will also be able to use the hall in the afternoons and evenings. ""I don't think it is a question of whether it will be occupied or not. There is also a lot of interest from associations and individuals from the surrounding municipalities. I think we could easily fill the dates, even if we had another hall,"" says Kolar, who is particularly pleased that the municipal administration has managed to carry out such a large investment without taking out a loan, thanks to the grants they have received. The EcoFund contributed 845 thousand euros for the low-energy facility, five hundred thousand were obtained from the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport, and a further 65 thousand from the Foundation for Sport.The EcoFund has also contributed 845 thousand euros for the low-energy facility. The contract value of the hall is €4.5 million, it was built by Graditelj from Kamnik, with whom Mengeš was very satisfied, and the interior fittings, worth €660 thousand, are being installed by Elan Inventa. <p/> The construction of the new sports hall will free up the current gym of the primary school, which is to be converted into a kitchen and dining room, as well as four additional classrooms. ""With almost nine hundred pupils, Mengeška Primary School is one of the largest in Slovenia. The municipality has already solved the space problem in the past by building extensions, first to the west, then to the east, and now the third phase, the reconstruction of the school gym, is on the cards,"" says Kolar, who adds that the procedures have already started, but it is too early to talk about the amount of the investment, as they need to get the designers' estimates first. The municipality will certainly have to take out a loan for the investment. <p/> The redevelopment of the gymnasium is therefore the final stage in solving the school's space problem, which will ensure that Mengeš has enough classroom capacity for the next few years. However, given that the immigration trend in the municipality is quite high and the population could easily grow from the current 8200 to tens of thousands or more in the next few years, any future space needs of the school will have to be solved by setting up a new primary school or a branch, Kolar believes.",News

Aljaž Omejec and Jernej Strnad put the home team in the lead right from the start. The score after the first quarter was 19 : 12 for the Ivanske basketball team. In the second quarter, the lead grew a bit more, but there were too many loose balls and mistakes in the game. That is why the home coach was quite vocal several times, asking for a more organised game and consistent execution of the agreed actions.

"Janša against the referendum <p/> 3 June, 2012 - 20:00 <p/> Text. <p/> Are the parties sincerely ready to ""unite"" for a radical limitation of the referendum? Prime Minister and SDS leader Janez Janša has surprised - and it seems that this will not be the first time - his colleagues and the political public. In order to complete his mandate and push through several difficult reforms, he is ready to compromise in any way that would limit the referendum. Even to stand his own positions on their head. <p/> For more careful political observers, however, this should not be too surprising. The government, as we can observe every day, insists on (social) dialogue whenever it is threatened with a blockade.

Only results matter, even before the EU institutions. <p/> One can imagine Janez Janša and his predecessor Borut Pahor in Brussels explaining the peculiarities of our state system and the possibility of a referendum to put the foot down on a hardly expected law or agreement. A pension or arbitration agreement, for example. They are probably not very interested in such explanations. As I said, it is only the results that matter.

"Description: Intensive industrial agriculture, as the second largest polluter of the environment, is increasingly subject to public pressure for sustainable agricultural production. There are no indicators to assess the sustainability of the production system (PS) as a whole. The aim of this thesis was to design and evaluate a tool for sustainability assessment of arable (wheat, spelt and oil pumpkin) and vegetable (cabbage and beetroot) production in four CS (conventional - CON, integrated - INT, organic - ECO and biodynamic - BD), using data from a field experiment at FKBV in the 2008 season. The Sustainable Process Index ® (SPI) for agriculture calculates the environmental footprint in m2 of all direct and indirect inputs used during production. The analysis shows that the differences between the PS are large, and the partial results of the environmental footprint indicate where improvements are needed during the production process. The environmental footprint was highest in the KON (total 3,005,108.9 m2) and lowest in the control (642,906.2 m2), the reference PS, for all the crops observed. Wheat had the largest environmental footprint in the KON (792,646.8 m2) and oil pumpkin the smallest in the control (113,334.7 m2) PS. The calculated environmental performance index (environmental footprint per unit of yield - kg) confirmed the SPI trend in most cases. The SPI is a good and accessible tool to show the sustainability and shortcomings of the PAs for growers, the public and policy actors.

"Mathematics Instruction for Primary School <p/> We may be the parent of a child who attends primary school and occasionally or regularly needs help with homework, or extra tuition before an exam because they may not be doing well in one of their subjects. But we no longer remember everything ourselves and find it difficult to help. Maths is usually the most difficult subject. And so perhaps maths tuition for primary school is needed. Mathematics is a big problem for many schoolchildren and they may need help from an expert to learn it. Maybe it is just a particular subject that is giving him difficulty, or whatever, and we are not confident enough in our own knowledge to be able to help him. And so we decide to use tutoring, which is usually the best possible solution and the appropriate help in this kind of situation. The great thing about tuition is that the instructor pays individual attention to the child, takes the time to look at what the difficulties are and makes a learning plan so that the material becomes clear and is understood as soon as possible. Whether the child is in primary school, secondary school or perhaps already studying. It is definitely a great way to help your child to get the knowledge they need and are currently lacking. What's also good about tuition is that the instructors identify the needs of the child and also have the right way or approach to teach them the most in a relatively short time. Of course, this is a great opportunity for those whose knowledge is deficient in a particular subject. When a child attends primary school, maths is usually the most pressing problem and, in general, if it is a child who is not good at maths in general, we will look for maths tuition for primary school. If we take on the task ourselves and want to help our child, we will surely find that primary school is not as easy as we once thought. We may not choose the right way of teaching, which would prolong learning, we may not have the right experience, and it is certainly different when someone other than the child's parent teaches the child.",Opinion/Argumentation

"The debate often brings to the surface first those values that people in the kindergarten, school, organisation think they ""should"" have or ""should value"" in order to be respected as much as possible by themselves and the organisation. <p/> We know that the values people express publicly can be very different from the values they express in their own actions and behaviour. People's behaviour often seems to 'violate' values that they claim to hold important and sacred. Such ""double morality"" is a commonplace phenomenon, reflecting the disconnect between one's actual values, what one really values and cares about, and how one would like others to see one. <p/> If this phenomenon is so typical of human beings, it is logical that it cannot be avoided when discussing values within an organisation. Such a discussion often brings to the surface, in particular, the values that people feel they ""should"" have or ""should value"" in order to make themselves and the organisation as attractive and respected as possible. <p/> If the values that are written down do not match those that the organisation and its people express in their actions and behaviour, they cannot have a positive impact on employees and users. <p/> Just as the ""double morality"" of the individual is unattractive, the ""double morality"" of the organisation, or the wide gap between its stated values and what its actions express, is an ideal breeding ground for cynicism, sarcasm, ridicule and other negative phenomena. Written values that are literally at odds with what happens in the organisation cannot possibly have a positive impact on its employees and users. On the contrary, they often become a source of further dissatisfaction. It is therefore all the more important that the debate on the values of the organisation really goes deep, not contenting itself with superficial answers, and that it examines and tests the values it evokes. <p/> For example, if the debate points out that what matters most to employees is ""good relations with users"", it is important to ask whether this is really being implemented in practice. Does the day-to-day behaviour of the organisation and its people really reflect this concern? Do their actions and procedures really reflect this? <p/> In summary, it is useful to talk about, discuss, clarify and define values. But in doing so, organisations should be as careful as possible to avoid the tendency to ""sugarcoat"" the truth, to portray values ""as they should be"" rather than ""as they are"". Otherwise, the debate on values can quickly turn into its opposite, which instead of having positive consequences, encourages cynicism, sarcasm and dissatisfaction, and has a negative impact on employees' motivation, work zeal and morale.",Opinion/Argumentation
"Turnkey prefabricated houses are available for anyone who wants to live in a cosy warm home. In addition to prefabricated houses, wooden houses are also an excellent choice. All information, benefits, contacts, opinions in one place. <p/> Category Archives. In Slovenia, wooden houses, wooden prefabricated houses are still quite unknown, not widespread. Most of the prefabricated wooden houses are made of logs. In terms of speed of construction, prefabricated wooden houses are built about as quickly as conventional prefabricated concrete houses. So there is no fear of construction taking too long. The main advantage of prefabricated wooden houses, at first sight, for us non-experts in this field, is that the material is wood. And it is high-quality solid wood, which is a completely natural, ecological material. So a prefabricated wooden house is homely, cosy, natural to look at. In addition, prefabricated wooden houses have good insulation, they are extremely safe in terms of seismic safety and, believe it or not, what is not apparent at first sight is that they are very safe from fire. So prefabricated wooden houses are no less fire-safe than a traditional prefabricated house. <p/> In any case, it makes sense to at least consider the possibility of a prefabricated wooden house, because it is a quality, natural, homely construction. Most people who decide to build a house do not even know that they have the possibility of living in a wooden house. And many experts in this field say that prefabricated wooden houses are the future in Slovenia, where we are known for the large percentage of forests. <p/> Building a house is the biggest material project in life for most people (Slovenians even more so). And it is usually a once-in-a-lifetime project, so the decision on what kind of house to build really has to be the right one. Or are we going to say, three years from now, when the neighbour has a special house, ""Ah, let's do it that way...""? No, it is not. So it is a very important decision. <p/>But there are many questions here. More and more people are asking whether prefabricated houses are the right decision. We have already talked about the facts that support prefabricated houses. But the decision is by no means over. When we decide to build a prefabricated house, some say a turnkey house, we have to ask ourselves - do we want a prefabricated house or a conventional house. The layman tends to lump the two together. But the differences are, in the eyes of the experts, extremely significant. Classic turnkey prefabricated houses have the walls made in the factory, then they are just erected on the building site. Skeleton prefabricated houses, on the other hand, require more effort and work on site, where the so-called skeleton is first assembled, then the walls are filled in. <p/> Many people are convinced by the quality of prefabricated houses, despite their perhaps slightly higher price. An essential feature of turn-key skeleton construction is the increased load-bearing capacity of the walls, which in turn means greater seismic safety, greater storm safety and greater fire safety. Turnkey prefabricated houses generally have extremely good characteristics, exceptional quality, and the proportion of these is increasing. Skeleton construction of prefabricated houses is considered by some to be the best quality choice at the moment. In the end, of course, the decision is yours. <p/> quickly built - a few months after the building permit is obtained <p/> extremely easy to build - no guesswork, no searching for craftsmen, no fixing complications, no searching for materials - all taken care of by the company you choose <p/> seismically safe <p/> very economical <p/> made from environmentally friendly materials. <p/> Contact us by filling in the form on the first page - we provide you with several manufacturers or prefabricated houses or wooden houses, and then you choose which one you like best - easy and fastest for you.",Promotion

"Do not leave children in the car! <p/> How many times have you been out on a trip alone with your child, and on the way you casually remembered that you had to go to the bank or the post office, and left your child waiting in the car because it was a really short errand? <p/> Although you may not have thought about it at the time, you should know that leaving children in the car can be extremely dangerous, not only in summer but also at all other times of the year. Do you want to know why? <p/> The sun heats the sheet metal <p/> Children are much more sensitive to heat than adults, which is especially dangerous in summer if you park your car in the sun. The inside of a car can heat up to 50 degrees Celsius or more in about 15 minutes, which can cause heat stroke in children. As well as the temperature itself, it is also important how the child is dressed and how old they are. The younger the child and the darker the colour of the car, the greater the risk. Conversely, the older the child is, the more easily he or she can withstand the heat, and the more likely you are to give him or her certain things, tell him or her to drink water and so on. And if you thought that a slightly open window was enough, you were wrong, because it doesn't make any difference. <p/> Villains at work <p/> It's not just the heat that can be dangerous for a child. Parents often leave the keys in the car when we have to run ""quick errands"", either because we leave the air conditioning on, the radio on, or because we're going to be ""back quickly"" anyway. In this case, although the child may not be hot in the car, the dangers are no less. However impossible and remote kidnapping may seem to us, the fact is that these crimes do not only take place abroad and on the cinema screen, but are, unfortunately, all too common in this country too. It also happens more than once that the villain is distracted by a car and, because he is in a hurry, he takes us both away. <p/> Young explorers <p/> Whether the car is exposed to the sun, whether we have left the keys in it or not, one thing is certain - children love to explore. Especially what they are forbidden to do in the presence of their parents. Of course, this depends on the age of the children - a baby is not interested in such things - but slightly older children are usually eager for the chance to satisfy their curiosity. Since we parents don't usually let them press buttons of all colours and shapes, play with levers, press pedals and turn steering wheels, they take advantage of our absence. They are too young to be aware of the dangers involved, so it is up to parents to take care of them. However short the task, you will probably agree that it is never, but never really, important enough to be worth the risk! <p/> Projects and actions",Opinion/Argumentation

"Okič, Fani: Kingdom of the Great Serpent: on the culture of the indigenous peoples of pre-Columbian America from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego <p/> This book is one of a trilogy on the ancient history of precivilizations.

The book is about the indigenous peoples of pre-Columbian America. Her very first sentence: 'The Kingdom of the Great Serpent is not a book about Indians. "", shows very clearly the author's disagreement with official history. America was not discovered by Christopher Columbus, but there have been many civilisations on this continent since prehistoric times that are not given the status they deserve by official history. Many of the archaeological remains that have already been discovered testify to their remarkable knowledge of construction, which has been overlooked, and many more are still waiting to be discovered.",Review

Then ..."" <p/> I cannot impose myself on the parties, says President of the Republic Borut Pahor in Večer. Selling companies, yes, but also the bad bank, the fiscal rule and the referendum regime. Brussels is waiting for that. Is the situation so serious that we need an army in front of the palace? <p/> Reporter: Katja Šeruga <p/> Really? The Slovenian Armed Forces Honour Guard will be stationed in front of the Presidential Palace on national holidays? You have decided so. How so? <p/> ""In my capacity as President of the Republic, I have been thinking from day one in the direction of the full regeneration of civic consciousness and belonging. That is what we lack. Even when it comes to purely practical action in a crisis. It is about a sense of self-confidence, of belonging to a community. I think that is what we lacked during the transition. It was lost when we were running after other goods. But now it seems to be very important. For our self-confidence and to cope with the circumstances in which we find ourselves. "" <p/> So serious that we need an army in front of the presidential palace? ! <p/> ""No. It is just that we have to realise that we have had a country for 22 years, that its symbols are a sign of our sovereignty and that they deserve a proper place. Both in our memory and in their presentation to the public, that they must be respected. And if we say that, because of the crisis, which is not only financial and economic but also moral, some old, traditional values are modern again, then it seems to me that, in its own way, it is also modern again to pay due respect to the symbols of statehood. ""<p/> Does this decision of yours entail any additional costs? <p/> "" No. "" <p/> Have you checked? <p/> "" This discussion is at least as old as the country ..."" <p/> ... your predecessor also thought about this, but had to change his mind. <p/> "" It was always thought that a guard of honour would be permanently stationed outside the palace. It would be there every day between 8 am and 6 pm. That would certainly not be financially neutral, as will the fact that it would - at least for the time being - only apply on public holidays. We shall see how our people react to this. ""How do you think they will react? <p/> "" I think very well. Because it is not about cost, but it is also an expression of sovereignty. Paradoxically. This decision comes at a time when there may be a suspension of that sovereignty with foreign help, although my thesis is that there will not be a suspension, that we will solve the problems ourselves, albeit through the eye of the beast. "" <p/>What do you mean? Since you are in Maribor, let me ask you this: is the troika already at Šentil? <p/> "" No. It is still in Brussels. The European Commission will issue a report on 29 May, which will go to the European Council for a decision at the end of June. The government has sent a strong signal that it is committed to consolidating public finances and to measures to stimulate economic growth, with some measures such as higher VAT and the successful negotiation of public sector wage cuts. But if I may take the liberty of assessing these measures, without prejudice to the competences of the government... I am missing two things. One is a much more active role for the state in the creation of the bad bank, where there is a series of activities in the transfer of bad debts. This would have let the European Commission know that we are serious about the rehabilitation of the banking system, which is a major stumbling block in our economic and financial regeneration. Secondly, and I may be wrong because I am not informed, I think that politics these days is significantly under-preparing for the end of the month, when Parliament will decide on the new referendum regime and the golden fiscal rule. The European Commission and the European Council are watching very closely what is happening here, particularly with the referendum legislation. You will recall that already on 14 February, at a meeting with the party presidents, which I hosted and chaired, it was agreed that the issue of the referendum regime would go through, but then one of the opposition parties (SDS, op. cit.) said that the fiscal rule had to be decided on before that. There is really no need to argue here about whether this party has that right or not. Without it, there is no two-thirds majority. However, the golden rule for two-thirds decisions is that the opposition sets the rules. That has always been the case. What is more, I believe that the year 2015 could have been written into the Constitution when the fiscal rule was introduced."" <p/> It is not possible. The coalition, especially the ruling party, is firmly in favour of 2017. That is when the rule should be implemented, that there is no way to a balanced budget before then. <p/> "" The Fiscal Compact allows for a transition period, which in our case would be made possible by an implementing law. No one expects the government to have to resign if it does not achieve a deficit of 3% in 2015. Anyone would understand that this cannot be achieved if the macroeconomic circumstances are actually deviating, if, for example, even a third major recession were to break out. Other countries are also familiar with such deviations. Therefore, I find this quibble about the year to be superfluous. I would have preferred to see a focus on the conditions of the transition period. I well understand the government and the Prime Minister that it would be inappropriate for the government to decide, at the price of rapid deficit reduction, to intervene brutally in the social fabric of the population, thereby also hurting the prospects for economic recovery in the long term. I have spoken about this during my visits to Berlin and Paris, and they understand our dilemma. ""Is it true that you went to Berlin and Paris convinced that the changes to the referendum system to reduce the possibility of referendums when it comes to reform issues would be faster and that the fiscal rule would come into force in 2015? That you promised that to Paris and Berlin, and then there was no meeting on 6 May on these two topics? You did not know? And another thing: during the campaign, Mr President, you were all betting on the involvement of politics. Only together we can do it, you said. Now, however, your cooperation with the Alenka Bratušek Government has not exactly got off to a good start. <p/> ""The cooperation between the government and the President's Office is still exemplary ..."" <p/> ... still exemplary? <p/> "" It is exemplary. But the fact is that after 14 February, when I personally took responsibility for ensuring that the parties were united on three issues - ratification of the accession treaty, labour market reform and referendums - all the parties were no longer in favour of me as President taking a similar role on constitutional change, but felt that it would be better if this process remained within parliamentary life. This means that I can encourage party dialogue, but I cannot lead it and bring it to an end. I went to Paris and Berlin after talking to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance. I was confident that on 6 and 7 May Parliament would approve the decision on referendums and the fiscal rule. I have told you frankly that I am concerned that this decision, which may also be complicated, has been postponed until the end of the month. I also believe that the parties should already be talking intensively about this now, but I am not informed that they are. If the parties consider that I can help, I am prepared to do so. But I can see their adherence to the February agreement on changes to the referendum arrangements slowly melting away. It would be irresponsible of me to ignore that, and I think that people voted for me also because I have the experience of being Prime Minister. We can get out of the crisis, but we also need to agree on the fiscal rule and referendums."" <p/> Excuse me, the people also voted for you because you made a firm promise to bring the warring political forces together. Now you are telling us that the parties will not even allow that? That was your key election promise. <p/> "" You must admit to me that I have fulfilled it sooner than I thought. February. More as a joke than for real, we calculated that it took me 25 and a half hours just to coordinate with the parties to reach an agreement. ""Already, already, but the result you want is not there. At least not yet. <p/> ""Back in February, one of the party presidents (Igor Lukšič, op. a.) said that the February meeting was legitimate, but that he was not in favour of the President of the Republic interfering in party life. Until this position changes, I have no mandate to impose myself on the consensus of the political parties. I cannot impose myself, and the Prime Minister knows exactly that I always tell her that I am also here to help her if she thinks that my help is needed. You should know that I put the joker on the table in Paris and Berlin. I said that I would pledge my word that this government would succeed in meeting the expectations of the financial markets and the financial institutions. That no aid would be needed. Do not think that such visits can happen every month, because they cannot. And do not think that you can say that if the facts put you in a different light. If the parties have a clear interest in enforcing the fiscal rule and changes to the referendum regime, they need to start talking about it now. I take the opportunity of this interview to call on the parties themselves, or with my help if they think they need it, to find a solution to get the fiscal rule into the constitution and changes to the referendum regime. "" <p/> "" No, because it does not affect my work and the commitment with which I do it. But I think that the Office has calculated that my salary will be reduced by 263 euros as a result of the agreement with the public sector unions. ""It will not stop there. You will also pay higher taxes. <p/> "" Yes, and that is right. "" <p/> How do you feel when you read in Večer, when your salary is going to be lower and your taxes are going to be higher, that Zoran Janković has obtained a loan of EUR 250 000 from a bank that is not a state bank to cover a EUR 300 000 overdraft, which is something that someone without a real surname cannot obtain? How, Mr President? After five years of crisis and debate, what is there to give up, even for anomalies that, at the end of the day, we all pay for. <I will not comment on this particular case, and you will understand very well why. I will, however, remind you that I was not among the last to say that the value focus of this crisis is a sense of injustice. The only good thing about the crisis is that it has ended a dangerous process of transition that would have wrecked our society to the core, because the trend towards rampant privatisation and looting would have continued. It is also true that the nation's defence mechanism has been awakened. The people are even braver to act than the politicians at the moment. They have come to the common-sense realisation that this crisis is going to take us down, so politics now has more room for decisive action than it is taking. ""But the government has gone ahead with the announcement that it will sell 15 state-owned companies, including the bank. NKBM. Thanks to the SD, the hysteria called national interest may happen again. <p/> "" Please do not let there be anyone among your readers who would like the Troika to sort things out in the country. These are very crude decisions, purely in the direction of austerity and nothing in the direction of promoting growth. We will not be asked anything about privatisation either, about any interest. We are in Maribor. You mentioned NKBM. I have to say this to be credible. When my government's term of office was coming to an end, contrary to my opinion, AUKN misjudged things. It ordered state-owned companies, in the name of the national interest, to recapitalise NKBM at a share price that no sale today will achieve. We have lost a lot of money by doing so, and today we will sell NKBM at a much lower price than it was possible to recapitalise it with private capital at the time. And do not forget the small shareholders who believed in the bank and bought shares. There will be a lot of discussion about this in Maribor."" <p/> Also lawsuits, probably. <p/> "" Particularly in the case of NKBM, it is important to listen to small shareholders when selling. "" <p/> So you are in favour of selling state shares? <p/> "" Yes, absolutely. "" <p/> We recently heard in the German-Slovenian Chamber of Commerce that a German investor was ready to build a factory and create 200 new jobs in the north-eastern part of Slovenia, which is being battered by the crisis. Do you know why not? Because the municipality was not prepared to negotiate seriously on the price of the land. In the end, the investor walked away. To Slovakia. Is this the Slovenian way of creating jobs and attracting foreign investors? <p/> ""In Paris, French businessmen told me that Slovenia is an absolutely attractive country for a number of reasons - geopolitical, transport, value, security. But it has such a complex bureaucratic structure that it takes courage in the middle of the road. Then they go to Slovakia, where everything is simpler. But I am not in favour of going to the other extreme, of giving up all the regulations that protect the environment and the Slovenian worker, for example, but there are a whole series of completely unrelated regulations that are being abolished by all governments, but at the same time they are being redone. Simplifying the legal system is one of the essential tasks of the current government. We need to realise that we have made the country too expensive and too complicated. At a meeting with the mayors in Oplotnica, the mayors told me that investors end up coming to them too, and they cannot even explain what an investor has to do in order to be able to do business and employment in their municipality. "" <p/>You also said in that meeting with mayors that municipalities are an important pillar of stability in the country. Really? All 211 municipalities? <p/> "" The cost of discussing which municipality should be abolished will be much greater than the savings. It will be a political cost, it will be a material cost, and you will upset people. And you know that I have been a supporter of fewer municipalities all these years ..."" <p/> ... because that is exactly why. <p/> "" But today I have to estimate that if the question of reducing the number of municipalities were to be raised, we would also raise the question of which municipality to abolish, how many municipalities to abolish. We would be fighting people, we would be fighting parties, and the savings would not outweigh it. "" <p/>To draw the line slowly. We have had a crisis for five years, and you have been Prime Minister for three years in that time. Your most fatal wrong decision, which we are all paying for today, was? <p/> "" You were there when I said that. When neither you nor your colleagues expected such a sincere confession. That I realised too late what a fatal problem the banks are. I admitted it, I think, in January 2012."" <p/> No. I remember that. It was just before the presidential election. After you fell off the horse. <p/> "" Exactly. After the holidays, in September. I did not pay enough attention to the bailout of the banking system because of the preoccupation with Croatia. Even then, Minister Lahovnik proposed a bad bank, and I agreed with him, but both on condition that the bad bank would be made by NLB itself, not imposed by the state. Whereas, for example, Minister Gaspari advised against the creation of a bad bank at the behest of the state. At that time, we had about three per cent toxic claims in the banks, now it is about one fifth. I told the Prime Minister frankly that I knew she had reservations about the bad bank, that when the PS was still in opposition she was considering a referendum on the bad bank, but that now the bad bank had to be set up. Do we have a better solution than the recapitalisations that have already been tried and have failed? Beware, this is fatally linked to corporate over-indebtedness. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Bank of Slovenia also let off all the brakes on lending. No one considered whether these companies would be able to repay these loans. In 2009, however, we ran aground on over-indebted companies, which were further hollowed out by the crisis for their development."" <p/> "" You are now taking advantage of my poor character to make sure that I do not miss an opportunity to be quiet. I would not be surprised if the Commission said that it was giving Slovenia extra time to implement the things that it had announced but had not yet implemented. That would be a relatively favourable outcome. "" <p/> Do you expect a lower score? Alarm? <p/> "" It could be worse if the decisions on the referendum regime and the fiscal rule do not go through. A relatively favourable outcome on 29 May would reassure financial markets and the other two rating houses (S&P and Fitch) would not follow Moody's. But we have to be honest. But if the Commission had proposed to the European Council fines for Slovenia, which would have cost €35 million or a percentage of GDP, and a programme to correct macroeconomic imbalances, perhaps another rating house would have been moved. This would mean that Slovenia would virtually no longer have access to international financial markets. """,Interview

"The Core <p/> If at the time of entering into the contract of conveyance the conveyancer was aware of the legal consequences of entering into the contract of conveyance and had the will to enter into the contract of conveyance, the conveyancer will be deemed to have had the capacity at the time of entering into the contract of conveyance to enter into such a contract. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The appeal is allowed and the judgment of the Court of First Instance is modified so that the defendants are obliged to issue to the plaintiff, within 15 days, a land registration deed on the basis of which the plaintiff will be entitled to register the land in respect of the immovable properties No 83 of the Land Register No D. and No 756 of the Land Register No D. and No 756 of the Land Register No D. on their co-ownership interests, in order to register the title in his own name, since such a deed would otherwise be superseded by the present judgment, and to reimburse him, within 15 days, the costs of the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, amounting to EUR 5 930,52, with interest at the statutory rate of late payment, with effect from the 16th day following the date of receipt of the present decision, in the event of delay. <p/> The defendants are ordered to reimburse to the applicant, within 15 days, EUR 1 572,03 of the costs of the appeal, with interest at the statutory rate from the 16th day following receipt of this decision until payment. <By the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance dismissed the action for the issue of a land registry deed in respect of immovable properties No 83 of the Land Register of D. and No 756 of the Land Register of D. in the applicant's name, finding that the contract of conveyance of 19 September 1994 between the conveyancer, Mrs I.F., and the applicant was null and void. It is void because, at the time of the conclusion of the contract of assignment, Mrs F. was not capable of understanding the meaning and consequences of the contract of assignment (she lacked capacity to act). <p/> 2. Against the judgment of the Court of First Instance, the applicant appeals on all the grounds set out in Article 388(1) of the Civil Procedure Act, seeking an amendment of the judgment so as to uphold the claim, and, in the alternative, to set aside the judgment and refer the case back to the Court of First Instance for a new trial. The appeal challenges the finding of the Court of First Instance that, at the time of the conclusion of the contract of assignment, Mrs I.F. was not capable of understanding the meaning and consequences of the contract of assignment. Ms F's capacity to act is presumed and the defendants have not challenged that presumption. The mere existence of the disease of senile dementia is not proof that she did not understand the meaning of the contract of assignment. Expert B. was of the opinion that there was an 80 % probability that Mrs F.I. did not understand the meaning of the contract of assignment. On the basis of that expert's opinion, the presumption of the existence of Ms I. F.'s capacity to act is not rebutted. In the light of the circumstances, Mrs I.F.'s capacity was more or less preserved and she is able to express what she wants to do with her assets. <p/> 3. In their reply to the application, the defendants submit that a piecemeal, piecemeal assessment of the evidence cannot lead to the desired result that Ms I.F. had the capacity to act at the time of the signing of the contract of assignment. The Court of First Instance is autonomous in its assessment of the evidence. The emphasis on the bright moments of the handing-over of Mrs I.F. cannot be placed in the timeframe of the conclusion of the handing-over contract, since, apart from the date of conclusion of the handing-over contract, we do not know what state of mind Mrs F.I. was in when she concluded the handing-over contract. Expert B.B. did not conclude that Mrs F. I. was in a lucid phase at the time of the conclusion of the contract. Mrs F.'s will was not entirely free, as it was quite suggestible, but the proceedings have not proceeded in that direction so far because the parties have not claimed that it was. The expert, Mr B.B., did not speculate. He confirmed that his findings were correct, which means that I.F. was incompetent at the time of the conclusion of the contract of delivery. The plaintiff did not attend the hearings, which suggests that there was something wrong with the contract from the outset. <p/> 4. The Court of Appeal questioned the correctness of the Court of First Instance's assessment of the evidence and therefore held a main hearing, at which it repeated the evidence of the expert Dr Z. Č. At the time of the conclusion of the contract of delivery on 19 September 1994, Mrs F. was of legal age and therefore presumed to have had the capacity to act. It is for the defendant to prove that at the time of the conclusion of the contract of entrustment she lacked capacity, that she did not understand the meaning of the conclusion of the contract of entrustment and that she lacked the capacity to form the will to conclude the contract of entrustment. <p/> On the basis of the expert opinions of Dr. Z. Č. T. and Dr B.B., the testimony of the witness J.B. and the actions of I.F. after the conclusion of the contract of assignment (her statement at the Centre for Social Work Jesenice on 12.10.1994, the conclusion of the lease agreement on 14.12.1994 and the consequences of the dementia from which I.F. suffered), the Court of First Instance concluded that I.F. did not understand the nature of the contract which she had concluded with the claimant on 19.09.1994 and its legal consequences. The Court of Appeal takes a different view of that evidence, in particular because the experts fundamentally misinterpreted the statement made by Mrs F. before the Centre for Social Work Jesenice on 12.10.1994 and incorrectly linked that statement to the lease agreement concluded between Mrs F. and the applicant on 14.12.1994. <p/> It is clear from Ms F.'s statement of 12.10.1994 that she was aware that she had already handed over the property to the applicant (I myself wanted D.J. to have everything I had). I want him to have all my property after my death, or rather to have it already now. I.F. was also aware of why she was giving her property to the claimant, because he takes care of her and will continue to take care of her in the future (because he takes care of me, he is very good and I think he will continue to do so in the future). <p/> She also testified that her relatives are not interested in her or that they come to help her when they can and that they cannot come often. It follows from this statement that she wanted the continued assistance which the applicant had provided and had undertaken to provide in the future. <p/> It follows from Mrs F.'s statement that she understood the meaning of the contract of delivery of 19.09.1994, that she was handing over all her property to the applicant, and that she wished to enter into such a contract of delivery, that is to say, to form a business will to enter into such a contract, on the ground that the applicant would take care of her in the future. <p/> The experts' view that it is not logical that, after the conclusion of the contract of conveyance, I.F. and the applicant also concluded a lease contract on 14.12.1994 for an apartment on the first floor of the house is not justified, since at the time of the conclusion of the lease contract the contract of conveyance had not yet been registered in the land register and therefore the applicant had not become the land registry owner of the property conveyed. The conclusion of the lease contract is therefore a logical act, since by concluding it the applicant acquired the legal title to live in the house. When it was suggested to the experts that the conclusion of the lease agreement was logical, they replied that this was a legal view, not a psychiatric one. The court is not persuaded by such an answer of the experts. The logic of the transactions entered into is interpreted in terms of the need to enter into those transactions. Since the plaintiff had not yet acquired the legal title to live in the I.F. house by the mere conclusion of the contract of delivery, and the procedure for obtaining the status of farmer for the plaintiff had been delayed, it is logical and understandable that the plaintiff secured the right to live in the I.F. house by concluding the lease. <p/>Expert Dr. Z. Č. T. and Dr B. B. thus erred in considering that the subsequent conclusion of the lease contract implies that Mrs I.F. was not aware of the meaning of the contract of handover and that she was not capable of forming the will to enter into the contract of handover. The experts' request that Mrs F. should have stated in her statement of 12 October 1994 that she had already concluded the contract of usufruct is too strict, but in her statement Mrs F. testified to the essential elements of the contract of usufruct, namely that the property was already in the possession of the applicant and that the latter would take care of it in the future. <p/> Since it is clear from Mrs F.'s deposition of 12.10.1994 that she was aware of the importance of the contract of conveyance and that she wished to enter into it, it can be safely concluded that she also had such a wish on 19.09.1994, when she concluded the contract of conveyance. That will or capacity was not affected by her illness, dementia of old age, particularly in the light of the report on her state of health by Dr J.K. of 15.11.1994, in which he responded to enquiries made by the Centre for Social Work concerning the state of I.F.'s health. in which he stated that she was oriented in terms of personality, location and time, and the letter of 22.11.1994 from the nurse responsible for her care, Ms J.B., in which she stated that she had visited Ms I.F. four times since March 1994 and that she considered her to be of sound mind and health for her age. However, at the hearing on 19.11.2007, J.B. testified that she remembered I.F. as a confused, demented person who could no longer look after herself and needed help. When J.B.'s letter of 22.11.1994 was read to her, she stated that she remembered the case well at the time, but today she remembers I.F. as she described her at the hearing. It should be borne in mind that she had visited her 10 times, i.e. that she had continued to visit her even after she had made her statement of 22.11.1994. Her statement at the hearing is therefore not contradicted by the letter of 22.11.1994, it is only the timeframe to which the statement refers that is relevant. It follows from the statement of 22.11.1994 that this statement refers to the time up to the date of the statement, whereas the statement at the hearing on 09.11.2007 refers to the entire memory of her. <p/> Expert B.B. explained that confusion in dementia occurs in intervals of varying length, which means that a person with dementia is not mentally confused between the intervals. He was of the opinion that I.F. did not understand the meaning of the contract of conveyance at the time of the conclusion of the contract of conveyance, which he gave with a probability of 80 %. Such an opinion by Dr B.B. does not, therefore, rebut the presumption that Mrs F. had capacity at the time of the conclusion of the handover contract of 19 September 1994. For that reason, it is also not possible to follow the opinion of the expert Z. Č. T., that at the time of the conclusion of the handover contract I.F. was incapable of understanding the meaning of the handover contract, since both opinions are based on the same assessment of the facts, only that they ultimately assess them differently. <p/> As regards the testimony of the other parties and witnesses, it should be made clear that they gave their testimony as they saw and perceived it when they were in contact with Ms I.F.. However, in view of her illness, age-related dementia, which occurs at intervals, this may have been in a phase of confusion or in a phase of lucidity and therefore cannot affect the assessment of the evidence itself, given that it can be concluded with certainty from her statement before the Social Work Centre on 12.10.1994 that she was aware of the significance of the handover contract and that she had the will to form the basis of such a handover contract of 19.09.1994. <p/> 7. The amendment of the judgment affects the amendment of the decision on costs. The applicant was successful in the proceedings and must therefore reimburse the defendants for the costs of the proceedings before the Court of First Instance, which are assessed at a total of EUR 5 930,52 (EUR 3 474,83 for the costs of legal representation and EUR 2 474,83 for the costs of the lawyer).455,69 for fees, expert fees and travel costs), and to reimburse him EUR 1 572,03 in respect of the costs of the appeal (EUR 492,60 in respect of the appeal fee, EUR 407,59 in respect of the costs of drafting the notice of appeal, EUR 331,58 in respect of the costs of attending the main hearing on 14 February 2011 and EUR 340,26 in respect of the costs of the expert). <p/> The defendants shall pay the costs of the proceedings to the applicant within 15 days, with default interest at the statutory rate from the 16th day following receipt of this decision.",Legal/Regulation

Wondering where to buy the best quality safety glasses? The answer is Trgos in Lesce. We specialise in importing and selling top quality workwear, hearing protection and eye and head protection (hard hats and more). <p/> Safety glasses available in different designs <p/> Before choosing the right safety glasses, you should think carefully about the features you expect. Is it important that the goggles are equipped with solar filters? Are you looking for safety glasses with lenses that do not dew? Perhaps you need chlorofibre safety glasses? Do you wear corrective glasses and are interested in safety glasses that can be worn over traditional glasses? Do the glasses also need to have side protection? We have a range of safety glasses suitable for different circumstances, so finding the ideal glasses to protect your vision while you work won't be difficult. Of course, we can help you choose the really best safety glasses for your specific circumstances, but we're also the right place to go if you're interested in hearing protection at work. <p/> Optimum hearing and head protection <p/> In many jobs, hearing protection and head protection with the help of a safety helmet is also very important. Hearing protection can sometimes be provided with good quality earplugs, but there are also circumstances where full hearing protection requires the use of mufflers. Whatever kind of hearing protection you are interested in, you will find the ideal ear or hearing protection here. Probably even more important than hearing and eye protection are safety helmets. Among other things, we offer a safety helmet with a visor made of golden, dark glass. A visor helmet provides complete protection for the entire head. Thus, a visor helmet is an accessory that protects you from many dangers and is therefore definitely worth buying.",Promotion

"Berdych defeats defending champion in Stockholm final <p/> 19.10.2014 <p/> STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN - Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic triumphed at the ATP250 tournament in the Swedish capital. He had to beat defending champion Grigor Dimitrov to win the title, but with new points for the ATP Race Rankings, he kept his chances for the final Masters alive. <p/> Tomas Berdych reached the final of the If Stockholm Open for the second time. In the final, he defeated Grigor Dimitrov, who won here last year, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4. <Berdych, 29, does not yet have a ticket to the final eight, but he retained his 7th place today, which still leads him to London. The Czech is chasing a fifth consecutive appearance at the O2 Arena. Today's success means he now has 10 ATP titles and is the ninth tennis player to have more than one win in this tournament, which has been around for 45 years. <p/> ''This is the first and only tournament I have won at least twice. I really feel great here, the organisers take care of everything we need. That's the reason I keep coming back, I feel at home'', said the Czech tennis ace after his hard-fought victory. He could have saved the opening set in his favour when he served at 5-4, but Dimitrov had other plans. The Bulgarian stole a set from the Czech by winning four games in a row. Berdych did not make the same mistake in the second and third sets and took the break advantage safely to the end. <p/> ''I lost the opening set because Dimitrov played unbelievable. I was very happy with my serve in the second set, which helped me to finish well,'' explained the Czech. <p/> Tomas Berdych celebrates his second win in Stochholm and 10th of his career <p/> Grigor Dimitrov lost today, but is still in contention for the final in London. He is currently 11th in the ATP Race Rankings, 330 points behind Murray, who is still in eighth place, which is still enough to qualify. All credit to Tomas, it's tough after losing the final, but he was better'', said the Bulgarian, who will play in Basel next week, while Berdych will travel to Valencia.",News

"Beta Carotene 9000 <p/> Product Description <p/> Lion Kids C 12,00 € 9,00 € <p/> Beta Carotene 9000 <p/> Vitamin A, Night Blindness <p/> Beta Carotene is first associated with the root, which is a well-known natural remedy for the prevention of night blindness since history. Since it is fat soluble, it is recommended to consume it with some fat. When consumed, it is slowly converted in the body into vitamin A in the liver and also has antioxidant properties. The body converts it as needed, but in children this conversion is not as extensive as in adults, so vitamin A deficiency can occur. It plays an indispensable role in bone growth and building, skin repair, good eyesight, reproduction and is an extremely powerful stimulant of the immune system. Symptoms of vitamin A deficiency include night blindness, eye problems, problems with blood formation, diarrhoea, skin diseases, susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infections. Night blindness can develop into severe visual impairment. <p/>Who we recommend it for: <p/> To people who want to maintain good eyesight <p/> Before going on holiday to prepare the skin for sun exposure, and to anyone who wants to keep their tanned complexion a little longer <p/> To people who are deficient in Vitamin A <p/> Beta Carotene for good eyesight <p/> Beta Carotene is a precursor of Vitamin A; it can be converted by the human body into Vitamin A according to need. Vitamin A is a building block of the retina, an essential part of our eyes with an indispensable role in maintaining good vision. Vitamin A also contributes to the maintenance of healthy mucous membranes and healthy skin. <p/> Benefits of vitamin A <p/> As a powerful antioxidant, vitamin A protects the brain from premature deterioration, protects against the effects of UV rays and strengthens the immune system. The need for this vitamin is greatly increased in all intestinal diseases with consequent impaired absorption, chronic diseases and exhaustion. As it also protects the skin well against the sun, it is recommended to take it during sunbathing. <p/> It is recommended to start taking beta-carotenes at least 2-4 weeks before prolonged sun exposure and to continue during the sunbathing period, together with the use of a sunscreen with an appropriate SPF. <p/>Warning: The recommended daily amount or dose should not be exceeded. A food supplement is not a substitute for a balanced and varied diet. Keep out of reach of children! Store at temperatures up to 25 oC, protected from moisture and light. <p/>Warning: Smokers and persons working with asbestos should consult a doctor before use. Beta carotene is not a substitute for external UV protection. Prolonged use of high doses of beta carotene may cause staining of the hands and feet, which is perfectly normal and disappears after discontinuation of the supplement.",Promotion
"Well, come to my house for a visit...my child is currently a meat eater, so I'm almost worried, she's not interested in anything else...she eats sausages out of her sandwich, throws vegetables on the floor for the dogs, leaves potatoes and rice on the plate, and she happily munches on sausages and steak. And she has everything her heart desires at her disposal : <p/> +1 She wants no fruit, no pasta, no potatoes, no vegetables, no fruit ... And his mother eats almost only vegetables and fruit, and his father only starches. <p/> On a neighbouring forum someone was being persuaded not to buy a mix. I quote the part of the text that speaks against buying the mix: <p/> ""...both cavalier and pug breeds have heart problems and that no matter if the dog is a mix or pedigree that you have to know that treatment is expensive, I have a cavalier with pedigree and we have been keeping him alive for 3 and a half years now only with medication, how much did all the visits to the vet, all the medicines cost me, and I don't add it up, but probably about 2000 euros, and probably more, so buying a dog is the cheapest, but if you buy a dog from a proven breeder you will know that the dog will start to have heart failure at the age of say 8, 9 years..."" <p/> So why should I buy a dog with a pedigree? Why already? This writing certainly discourages me from doing so. <p/> Maybe you know which tests are mandatory for pugs and cavaliers for breeding? One, several,...? (I really don't know, that's why I'm asking) <p/> but if you buy a dog from a proven breeder you will know that the dog will start to have heart failure at say 8, 9 years old, and I know of a case of a non-breeding cavalier who has a grade 4 heart murmur at 4 years old (which mine had at 8 years old). <p/> ALL cavaliers have heart problems. If you buy from a proven breeder, problems will appear at 8,9 years, if not they can appear much earlier. <p/> (it's half a question why a person would want a dog that has heart problems from the start, but ok, to each his own) <p/> @salad Ever since user 007 asked a simple question on the ""neighbouring forum"", in the next 3-4 pages, the ""genealogical automaton"" kicked in and uncontrollably started spewing the same learned phrases, which are TOTALLY not the answer to the question asked, and started to savagely rape the person with its logic, which doesn't allow for a different opinion. Unfortunately, the ""automated slaves"" of the genealogy lobby are also on this forum, and here too they impose their beliefs on the users. <p/>Why? It is just a problematic breed in certain health aspects. Why hide it? I mean, if one paragraph is taken out of context, it's despicable anyway. This dog, if I am not mistaken, is about 9 years old. And it is quite right to warn a person who does not know what he is buying that both breeds can be risky, especially if the parent dogs have not had heart health tests. <p/> And this mix would do nothing to improve health, quite the opposite. And if it has already been used and the dogs are not under control, there is no need for the ""breeder"" to deceive the potential guardians of the calf puppies with silence. Or I suppose it is possible that he has told them, but given the general reaction, I don't think he has. <p/> Are you both saying that the problems should not be talked about? Given that traceability is possible, they can be talked about at all, but not in the case of a mixed breed, which doesn't mean it will be healthy <p/> And to be left in the dark... it is precisely through controlled breeding that things can improve. But without control, without tests, preferably with the first one around the corner, you really can't reduce the incidence of certain defects. Tests are definitely not everything, but they can help with many things, and there is always a risk. We are talking about living beings, not carbon fibre <p>An answer that tells a person what the characteristics and needs of BOTH breeds are and that's enough. But the man has been given a ""lecture"" which he did not commission and is not prepared to pay for. He pointed this out a couple of times and then gave up. <p/> To me, he looked like someone who wanted to buy the cheapest possible gift, and in general he got very comprehensive answers (although he did not expect them to be comprehensive) and even surprisingly he did not just get lessons about not buying animals as gifts. You can only make a conclusion from what is written... what the heck... that's the way it is on the forum... <p/> Yes. Functional illiteracy and/or intolerance of dissent. Unfortunately, it's not just like that on the forum. <p/> There are already too many of those. They were created when standardisation started, which if I'm not mistaken was in the Victorian era. You win ;-) Everyone has their own views on the world, animals etc. You don't have any. <p/> I would like to ask you something else. Maybe somebody lives in Vic. We could get together sometime and go I don't know to PST or the carob. We moved here recently so we don't know any or very few. We always need company:-) <p/> You know what saddens me the most? E.g. this: http://www.pesjanar.si/forum/index.php?topic=151.90 And right on the neighbouring forum, and elsewhere, they support so called ""controlled pedigree breeding"". What is controlled here? And this is not an isolated case, there are many, too many. Are they to be believed? They don't convince me... <p/>These defects are now being diagnosed, but that doesn't mean they weren't there before. <p/> Before, when you asked why you didn't have a dog anymore, they said, ""He was old"", and he was maybe a little over seven years old... One of the examples I have encountered in my life... And what do you say to them? (it was a village mixed breed) I am not saying that mixed breeds are more or less sick, but that you can't conclude from the number of visits to the vet how healthy they are. Because the one above must have died of old age, and yes, when you talk about the breed, there is the possibility of finding out a bit more about the history of the previous breeds, which is unfortunately not possible with mixed breeds, because nobody knows anything, unless they are all from the same village and people know them.... In that case they are usually much more closely related than some pedigree dogs. (villageinbriding) <p/> Hudma, he himself wrote that he was buying a dog as a gift, but he was actually looking for a pug...really gross illiteracy. Otherwise, it has nothing to do with this topic... Do you approve of buying a living creature for someone who has no idea what is in store for him? No one deserves that, not the giver and not the animal. If the recipient is younger, his parents are he he he <p/>salad, are you sad about the ultrasound? Aren't you in favour of the unsupervised? <p/> Yes, because it's clear to me that there are certain things you just don't want to know ....on the neighbouring forum all the ""evidence"" has been carefully deleted, that's how it's done here, I'm afraid. I will quote the following text: <p/> "" I am contacting you because I would like to warn potential buyers of my experience of [name and surname deleted at the request of the author, and the name of the kennel], which has been anything but pleasant. <p/> Around Christmas 2009 my partner and I bought a little bull terrier from her, who was just over 2 months old at the time. After much cajoling to hand over the papers, we went to her a couple of months later to get the pedigree, and then she asked, a little strangely, how much our Oscar was drinking, because one male from that litter had already died because his kidneys had failed because he was licking the salty snow by the roadside (which is, of course, a big stupid thing to do!). While nothing was clear to us at the time, we soon found out why she was asking such strange questions - we took the puppy to the vet, who diagnosed congenital chronic kidney failure and told us that his days were numbered. We informed [name removed] and asked her what she was going to do about it. She offered to buy another dog for a 'symbolic' price, but we refused and asked for a refund. She promised to send a reply by e-mail, but nothing happened for two months. In the meantime we met others who had bought dogs from the same litter and warned them about the disease. It turned out that out of the 6 dogs from the litter, 2 were already dead and 2 had severe kidney damage. I have no information on the other two. When we asked [name deleted] why she had not informed any of us that there might be something wrong with the dogs, she replied that she did not want to panic. Even after we had informed her about Oscar (so 2 puppies were already dead and one was sick), she did not warn anyone. <p/> As she had not emailed anything for two months, we called her and after many calls she did come back. In the meantime, Oskar had already been euthanised. When asked why she had not replied as promised, she said she had not had time. When my partner asked her if she was making a fool of him for not having had 10 minutes in two months to write an e-mail, she told him that if he meant to be rude, she would hang up. When he told her that Oskar was gone, she first asked ""How is he gone?"", but when he explained that we had had him euthanised, she was all amazed, as if she had not known that he was ill, and as if we had had the dog put to sleep just for a bit of a joke. And again she promised to send an e-mail. Today it is 14 days since that call, and I have not heard from her. I understand that puppies have unforeseen health problems, but for her to persistently proclaim herself a great dog lover, then hide the facts and react in this way to the fact that more than half of the litter is seriously ill or already dead, and yet tell no one and persistently avoid contact, to me clearly shows her attitude to animals. <p/> I would therefore caution anyone who may wish to buy a puppy from [name of kennel deleted, at the request of the author] to think carefully about it, because, while everything seems fine on their side, our experience and that of others who have bought puppies from this litter suggests otherwise. "" <p/> Will something be clearer now? This is how it is in the St. Florian Valley....this is what is supported here! <p/> Yes, my sorrow! You can find scum everywhere. And what doesn't convince you? Are you going to lump everything together because of some bad breeders? And purebreds without pedigree convince you, huh? The ones who haven't had a single test. Hehehe, you're the one who should believe the tests you're going to get from a breeder rather than from a home breeder! <p/>What to do with all the xy tests if such breeders are breeding? But nobody dares to comment on that? Why does such a breeder continue to breed? Why is he being advertised where they are the most vocal about supertruper honestly controlled pedigree breeding? Considering the number of ""renegades"" in slo, I doubt I can get a better (healthier) pedigree dog than a mix. And no, I don't trust our breeders. And I don't know what's funny here. <p/> Well, with all the xy tests (mandatory + desirable) that a breeder would show you, you could see that he actually cares about the health of the bitch, the puppies and the breed itself! Because if he didn't, he wouldn't even go to do them. A quasi breeder will never show you xy tests and you don't buy a dog from one! Simpl ko pasulj! <p/> I find your way of thinking funny. Let's say the bitch is having a fight with the neighbour's NO. She has a heart problem for example (when you come to see her she looks pure awesome) and he's a poor bastard who can barely walk and he's only 4 years old. You'd rather take the dog from me, because....... the puppies will be bursting with health because they are mixed-breeds? I can tell you fairy tales, but the one who has done the 5 tests has the proof <p/> Andreja, are you making fun of me???? QUOTE: Greetings, I am in the process of buying a dog, not for me, but I still need some advice. I am deciding to buy a pug, not a purebred, this one is a mix between a pug and a cavalier king charles. I would like to know if this dog is a lot of work, I have read a lot of things on the net, some people say that it is necessary to clean the fold every day, to comb it, that it is a special food, fruit... and that it is a quiet family dog, which is mainly intended for the house, I would like to have some more opinions from the owners who have this type of dog, thank you very much! <p/> I underlined his question, now you tell me where he is asking about my/your/our opinion on giving a dog away. PLEASE? The man is asking about the character traits and idiosyncrasies of a pug and a cavalier. BUT NO???? But is it so difficult to write a couple of answers to a SIMPLE question? <p/> The guy wanted to buy a dog as a gift. That's not how it's done. Regardless, he got the answers to his questions. He just didn't like them and didn't want to see them accordingly. He was told that he would not buy a pug (whose qualities he was interested in) nor a mix, but a cross between the two dogs. For which no one can predict what he will take from which parent (they are very different breeds in character and structure, the only thing they have in common is that they are not large (like crossing a Springer Spaniel with a Mastiff and wanting to know what you will get out). He was told that both breeds were medically demanding. Why? because most of the problems that afflict these two breeds are due to their physique. This problem is not due to standards, but both breeds have had this problem since God knows when - pugs are very old dogs, cavaliers a little less so, but both were around long before x-rays, ultrasounds...Be that as it may, the problems of cavaliers are such that it is difficult to weed them out of breeding, because there are no simple genetic or other tests to detect them before they occur. They do appear quite late in life. Now.... these problems are not hidden and are common knowledge. Anyone who nevertheless chooses to breed will look for parents who have their hearts checked regularly and those who have not had syringomyelia in a noticeable form in their ancestors. This is possible exclusively in pedigrees. Those who want a less risky breed will take a cockerel (which, unfortunately, is not so fancy). So the guy got the answer that a mix of these two breeds would be a risky purchase and that there was a high probability that the recipient would leave a hefty pile of money at the vets. OK? <p/> Hahaha oh how it was also conditioned by the standards (that the characteristics in the offspring are VERY similar from characteristics to looks). Quote from wiki:The King Charles changed drastically in the late 17th century, when it was interbred(Means to breed within a single family or strain, so as to produce particular characteristics in the offspring) with flat-bred breeds. I created a bunch of new problems that nowadays complicate this breed but not only that mostly everything. Not to say that there weren't problems before, but in very minor ways. How many breeds have problems with joints, breathing, massive eyelids to congenital diseases like chronic kidney failure,etc. People this is sick what is happening to dogs and don't give me crap how some xy tests can solve them because they can't. <p/> If a dog is a butcher (anything in this case without a pedigree), it is not a priori immediately healthy because of that (most people don't see a vet because of bad owners, not because of their brilliant health!). <p/> Just because a dog is pedigree doesn't mean it will be healthy all its life. If the breeder is on the spot, i.e. cares about the dogs, he will do all possible tests to avoid doing the vets a disservice. So, if by means of tests (for which you only need to take blood or saliva - once in the life of the dog, because they keep these things and then you can order a new test every month and don't have to get rid of it all at once) you can breed in such a way that you don't get out affected dogs, I don't understand why not. (I partly understand all of you who have non-breeding approaches, because you don't want to admit mistakes (you turn a blind eye, you fool the ostrich...) i.e. you support stepparies and the torture of animals. (There are ""specimens"" among breeders too, but it also depends on what is a ""specimen"" for you.)) <p/> Pidog. I may have hit the antijack road with the mesan in terms of their health. It's just my opinion that they are one of the few dogs (percentage-wise) that are cared for like pedigree dogs of less common breeds (in short, tipitopi or as the law says - if there is something wrong with the dog, vet and not sus). <p/> Well, yes, the history of kcs is much more complicated, but so be it - some breed expert could give more precise information. The problem with the kcs is not so much that they have a short muzzle (nor is it extremely short like, say, a pug) but that the skull is too short in the temple. <p/>Now...the question was yes or no to the deliberate production of dogs. And it's not really a question of yes or no, but how. Because the question of breeding dogs is not so very simple that you can lump everything together. But to say that in general breeds are better/worse than mixes in any trait. Because breeds vary so much from one another, and there are often huge differences between types within a breed. You have a number of breeds whose typical representatives are distinctly vigorous, hardy and long-lived, and you have breeds that have more or less difficulty in this respect. In principle, any breed characterised by an exaggerated trait is more at risk. However, with clever planning and selection, even in these breeds you can get healthy dogs that function perfectly normally. <p/> Usually the biggest problems arise when a breed's trait is to be changed at short notice. Usually, unfortunately, because of a fad of one kind or another. A desire to ""improve"" rather than preserve the breed. What role does the standard play in this? A standard is nothing more than a description of a typical representative of the breed. The problem is that what is written can be interpreted in different ways. It says, for example, the ears are long - and then it starts to select for the longest possible ears. In the standard it says long hair, but they start selecting for dogs with hair that drags on the ground. Apart from the fact that no exaggeration is good in itself, you almost always get a surprise in the package when you go to select for one trait rather than the whole. Usually unpleasant. <p/> Having said the bull terrier - in that breed they have gone to changing the almost normal skull shape to a sheep skull. In a very short time. They have got so many problems in the package that the breed is in serious trouble and those who love the breed and would like to save it will have to think honestly about how to proceed, make a well thought out plan and probably take a big step backwards. The problem almost always arises when too much emphasis is placed on show results when selecting dogs for breeding and when selecting combinations. <p/> Mixes... whichever - but the fact is that even those ""true"" mixes that have had pedigree ancestors going back I don't know how many knees, or never at all, have all the hereditary problems that plague pedigrees. There are not even a few mixed breeds with various hereditary diseases, but until recently there have been a few who have even been diagnosed. <p/>A few years ago we had a lost blind mix, of the 'foxy' variety that has been around in villages here for ages, with no identifiable breed inside..... was diagnosed with two different hereditary eye diseases and a third that was the result of one of the two. In addition, he had chronic digestive and skin problems. But we also had a pretty healthy mix who couldn't hide the Yorkshire in his background, who lived to be just over 20 years old <p/> only he doesn't want a conformation, he wants a breed.... (or a chrysance between two problematic breeds) <p/> I also partly understand all of you who keep barking the same five half-truths endlessly, because you are just not able to comprehend those who think differently. <p/> After reading such and such threads, I realised that there are more and more people buying from breeders...I was sure that this would change over the years, but it has got worse...this forum has also become just a chatterbox, since some people have newly signed up and are just looking for a breeder to fill their free time.... <p/>If a different opinion is so unacceptable, you can ban me, of course. But in doing so you will confirm my point about not accepting dissent. <p/> Put it any way you like, no matter how badly a breed is doing, the non-breeding approximations of that breed are doing even worse.",Forum

Low-energy buildings, and in particular passive buildings, are residential buildings whose primary purpose is to minimise energy consumption. <p/> By definition, a house should be low-energy when its heating energy demand is less than 50 kWh/(m ² a) and passive when it is less than 15 kWh/(m ² a). In practice, it may even be less than 10 kWh / (m ² a). <p/> Several factors are important for a building to reach these standards. The correct location and orientation, as well as the use of the right structures and materials, must be taken into account in the design and construction. <p/> The aim of this type of construction should be to minimise the energy used to heat and cool the building. <p/> This means that the following conditions must be met in the most efficient way possible: <p/> - use of solar energy directly through glass surfaces and indirectly through solar collectors for the production of domestic hot water, <p/> - the primary energy source for this type of building is the sun. However, in truth, we have to admit that in our region there are not many sunny days in winter. Therefore, on those days when the outside temperature is around 0°C or even lower, such facilities also need an additional source of energy. <p/> Most often, the additional source is a heat pump, which heats the building and provides the necessary amount of domestic hot water on cold days without solar radiation. <p/> As modern and technically sophisticated as heat pumps are, they also have drawbacks. As the ambient air temperature decreases, their efficiency decreases and the direct energy consumption increases. Another dilemma is what happens in the event of a power failure, which can sometimes last for a day or more. In this situation, this type of facility is completely helpless. <p/> All the above-mentioned devices - solar panels, heat pump and ventilation - are then useless. The very serious question is what to do in such a situation? <p/> One option is to use a solid fuel local heating system. But what kind? The building has a small, very meagre heat demand and all local solid fuel stoves are designed for a minimum of 6 kW and more. Such an installation would turn the building into a sauna, as the room temperatures would be significantly too high. But there is an answer, and that is a clay stove or a SMALL CLAY STOVE. <p/> 1 - Outside air inlet <p/> 2 - Fire door with glass <p/> 3 - Automatic combustion air inlet control <p/> 4 - Manual combustion air inlet control <p/> 5 - Fireclay combustion chamber - firebox <p/> 6 - Secondary combustion air inlet <p/> 7 - Afterburner zone <p/> 8 - Flue gas passage to flue ducts <p/> 9 - Fireclay flue ducts - 3m long <p/> 10 - Pottery lining <p/> 11 - Connection at top <p/> 12 - Connection at rear <p/> Most people think of a pottery stove as an artisan-built heating appliance, It is a stove heated with wood and heats one or at most two living spaces. We think of a rustic room, a mountain hut or a living room with a ceramic stove that warms the room in a cosy way. But in reality, the earthenware stove is an element that offers much more, because the possibilities of design and use of earthenware stoves in terms of design and thermal engineering are extremely wide. <p/> With the introduction of new living standards and the consequent construction of buildings with lower energy consumption, the need for individual solid fuel heating appliances of smaller size and power has become apparent. Manufacturers of earthenware stoves have identified a niche market and have adapted their products to this part of the market. We have developed so-called ""SMALL IRON STOVES"", which have the same characteristics as conventional designs, with the difference that they are smaller in terms of dimensions and heat output. <p/>Where are the advantages and why do customers choose such stoves? <p/> There is an increasing trend towards smaller living units and low-energy buildings where energy consumption is minimal and conventional solid fuel heating appliances are simply too powerful. <p/> Heat outputs of 1.2 - 3.0 KW using 3 to 5 kg of firewood per fire are ideal for this type of building. <p/> The operation of the combustion in the firebox is therefore completely independent of the room air. The combustion air can be controlled either manually or automatically. In the latter case, the microprocessor controls the air supply to the firebox via a control damper. <p/> The method of heat transfer by gentle radiation of the ceramic surfaces offers the most suitable solution in terms of health, comfort and convenience for man. As the proportion of convective heat transfer is lower due to the low surface temperatures, the movement of warm air through the room is also less intense, resulting in less dust particles being raised. This fact is particularly important for people with various allergies. <p/> The ability of fireclay materials to accumulate heat allows for a long heating cycle of up to 12 hours. This means loading firewood twice a day and thus very easy operation. <p/> Due to the modern technically sophisticated construction of the firebox and flue and thus the perfect combustion technique, the efficiency of the stove is very high, over 85, which means a low consumption of firewood and thus cheaper heating and less landfill. <p/> The perfect combustion results in high temperatures in the firebox, which means higher efficiency and more favourable emissions. <p/> The lifetime of such a stove is very long (at least one generation), which means that the investment is very rational. A long-term investment in a reliable, environmentally friendly and low-cost heating method. Maintenance and operation is simple. Wood biomass is used as the energy source, which is the most ecologically advantageous yet the cheapest. The glass fire door allows visual contact with the flame, which attracts people and offers them additional comfort.Installation is quick and clean. <p/> Design is also very important. In addition to the dimensional and design specificities, all stoves have a choice of glazing colours or colour combinations. With a choice of different glaze combinations, each customer can choose the colour idea that suits them. This gives each kiln a completely individual character tailored to the wishes and needs of the customer and makes it completely unique. <p/> And there is one more thing <p/> Every stove is an ornament and a decorative element in a room. In addition, firing and operating a tiled stove is a very special and enjoyable task. What makes it special is the pleasant radiation of heat through the walls of the stove and the many functional possibilities. The wood-burning fire is pleasantly felt through the open fireplace door, and fire has remained a source of heating from prehistoric times to the present day. Burning wood gives us a feeling of relaxation. It is a special ritual that is the same for each of the earthenware stoves. In each hearth, a large amount of energy is released when the fire is lit. This is stored in the fireclay mass of the earthenware stove and radiates into the room as a gentle, soft heat for hours afterwards. <p/> The heater operates independently of the electricity in the house or the oil in the tank. Pot stoves cover the need for heat in the way that ancestors once did. This is still the case today, and will continue to be the case long after oil and gas are long forgotten sources.",Promotion

"As regards the mental anguish resulting from reduced activity in life, it cannot be disregarded that, according to the expert's findings, only 20 % of the applicant's incapacity for work is due to the injuries sustained by the applicant in the present accident, and 80 % is attributable to a pre-existing medical condition. In this respect, the issue is one of shared causation. <p/> Operative part of the judgment <p/> The review is dismissed. <p/> Reasons <p/> The Court of First Instance rules that the defendant must pay the applicant SIT 2 460 020 in damages, with statutory default interest from SIT 36 660 from 1.4.1998 until payment, from SIT 3 360 from 21.7.1998 until payment and from SIT 2 300 000 from 7.3.2003 until payment. It further ordered the defendant to pay the applicant an annuity of SIT 2 000 per month from 1.4.2003 by the 15th day of each month for the preceding month. The Court dismissed the applicant's claim for higher relief. It held that the defendant was strictly liable for the damage suffered by the applicant in the accident of 28.1.1998. It awarded the injured party damages of SIT 900 000 for the physical pain suffered, SIT 200 000 for the fear, SIT 1 000 000 for the mental pain resulting from the impairment of his activity in life and SIT 200 000 for the mental pain resulting from the disfigurement. <p/> The Court of Appeal partially upheld the litigants' appeals and amended the judgment of the Court of First Instance by awarding the applicant, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, pecuniary damages of SIT 2 500 000, with default interest from 1 January 2002 to 7 March 2003 at the statutory default interest rate less the base rate, and from 8 March 2003 at the statutory default interest rate. The Court of First Instance dismissed the appeals and upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance in all other respects. It accepted the applicant's plea that the compensation for mental pain and suffering as a result of the injury was too low and awarded her SIT 400 000 for that purpose, while it considered the compensation for the other forms of non-pecuniary damage awarded to the injured party by the Court of First Instance to be appropriate. <p/> The applicant brought an appeal against that judgment on the ground of error of substantive law. The applicant requests the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia to uphold it and to amend the judgment under appeal, in so far as it rejects the application, by awarding the applicant, in addition to the pecuniary damages of SIT 2 660 020 already awarded, SIT 2 000 000, with statutory default interest from 14.10.1999 until payment, and statutory default interest on the damages already awarded from 14.10.1999 until 31.12.2001. The applicant submits that, although the lower courts correctly established the factual situation, they subsequently awarded the injured party inadequate compensation for all forms of non-pecuniary damage. In awarding damages for the mental anguish resulting from the impairment of the applicant's activities in life, the Court of First Instance should not have followed uncritically the expert opinion of Dr W. that the applicant's classification as a category III invalid was only 20 % due to the physical injuries sustained in the accident and 80 % due to his medical condition. It was only as a result of the permanent consequences of the injuries sustained on 28.1.1998 that the applicant was classified in category III of invalidity, since he was no longer able to work. He was 48 years old at the time of the incident and will therefore have to endure the mental pain of reduced activity for a very long time. The Courts of First and Second Instance ignored the fact that the accident occurred in 1998 and that the defendant has not yet paid any compensation to the applicant. The decision on the commencement of interest on the pecuniary compensation for non-material damage is also incorrect. Neither the Law on Obligatory Relations (Official Gazette of the SFRY, No 29/78-57/89, ZOR) nor any other law provides that interest on compensation for non-material damage is payable to the injured party only from 1 January 2002. In view of the stabilised economic and economic situation in the country, the monetary claim for compensation for non-material damage is payable after the expiry of a period of 14 days from the date on which the defendant received the claim and the documentation. The applicant sent the claim to the defendant on 29.7.1998 and the defendant received it on 30.7.1998, and has therefore been in default of payment since 13.8.1998. According to Article 277 of the Civil Code, a debtor who defaults in the performance of a pecuniary obligation owes interest in addition to the principal. The case-law to date has neglected the function of interest, which consists in the penalty for failure to comply with a monetary obligation in time. Such a decision is contrary to Article 17(1), (12), and Article 919(1) and (3) of the Civil Code. <p/> The review was served on the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Slovenia and on the defendant, who did not reply to it. <p/> The audit is not substantiated. <p/> Pursuant to Article 370(3) of the Civil Procedure Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 36/04 - Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia, p. 36), the review court and the parties are bound by the factual basis arising from the grounds of the judgments of first and second instance, and therefore, pursuant to Article 371 of the Civil Procedure Act, the review court examined the contested judgment within the limits of the ground raised by the reviser, namely error of substantive law. <p/> The fundamental principles governing the assessment of compensation for non-material damage are the principle of individualisation and the principle of objective conditionality of the amount of financial compensation. The principle of individualisation requires the determination of fair compensation in the light of the intensity (degree) and duration of the physical and mental pain and suffering and distress in the light of all the concrete circumstances of the individual victim. However, in accordance with the principle of the objective conditionality of the amount of pecuniary compensation, the court, in assessing it, must have regard to the importance of the good affected and the purpose of the compensation, and must ensure that it does not give way to tendencies incompatible with its nature and social purpose (Article 200(1) and (2) of the CPA). The Court of Second Instance, by awarding damages for physical pain (SIT 900 000), fear (SIT 200 000), mental pain due to the impairment of life activities (SIT 1 000 000) and mental pain due to disfigurement (SIT 400 000), found that the Court of First Instance had failed to award damages for the following reasons000) correctly met the legal standard of just pecuniary compensation, since the damages awarded are comparable to those awarded for similar harm and take into account all the applicant's individual characteristics, including her age at the time of the harmful event (see the reasons for the judgment of the Court of First Instance on pages 6 to 8 and the reasons for the judgment of the Court of Second Instance on page 3). As regards the mental pain resulting from reduced activity in life, it cannot be disregarded that, according to the expert's findings, only 20 % of the applicant's incapacity for work is due to the physical injuries sustained by the applicant in the present accident, and 80 % is attributable to a pre-existing medical condition. In that respect, the question of shared causation is one which the courts of the lower instances have resolved correctly in substantive law and in accordance with settled case-law. Since the applicant's current state of health or incapacity for work is also due to health problems which pre-date the harmful event, the defendant cannot be held liable for that part of the damage which is not attributable to the conduct of its insured. (1) <p/> The decision as to the commencement of interest is also substantively correct. The Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia, in a legal opinion of principle of 26.6.2002, adopted a position which ties the commencement of statutory default interest on a pecuniary claim for non-pecuniary damage (Articles 179-183 of the Law on Obligations, Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No 83/01, OZ, or Articles 200-203 of the Civil Code) to the entry into force of the OZ (1.1.2002), provided that an additional condition of delay in performance on the part of the person who caused the damage is also met at the same time. The applicant's legal position, which considers that it is in any event decisive when the insurer received the claim for compensation with the applicant's medical records, referring to the provisions of Articles 12, 17(1), 277 and 919(1) and (3) of the Civil Code, is erroneous, since it would lead to unequal treatment of the injured party, contrary to the constitutional principle of equality (Article 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia) and to the principle of equal protection of the rights of the injured party (Article 22 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia). <p/> The reality in the field of compensation litigation is that courts generally award compensation several years after a claim has been lodged. This reality means that, in the area of data on damages awarded by the courts, they reflect, among other things, a measure of the time lag between the moment of the decision and the occurrence of the damage. In other words, the amounts of damages awarded, which the Court used for comparison purposes, also took into account the factor of waiting for compensation as an important element. <p/> Since neither the grounds on which the revision was brought nor the grounds which the Court of Review is required to take into account of its own motion are present, the Court of Review dismissed the revision (Article 378 of the Civil Procedure Code). <p/> Footnote (1): The case-law on the issue of shared causation has been settled by a legal opinion adopted at the General Session of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia on 15.12.1998, Legal Opinions II/98, page 12.",Legal/Regulation
"The Heart Trail in Carinthia <p/> The Heart Trail is approximately 5 kilometres long and has an altitude difference of 180 metres. It is marked with a coloured signpost and almost 20 information boards. It takes about an hour and a half to walk along the trail, and even longer if you actively explore the sights indicated on the signs. <p/> The idea of the Heart Trail was born when looking for ways to offer people a health break. The study circle of Jožica Heber from Dravograd, which is part of the Slovenian Heart and Vascular Society, came up with the idea of a trail, designed and marked it, and offered it as an option for recreational hikes. The technical and organisational work was carried out by Ludvik Pušnik from Dravograd, and the idea was supported by the Dravograd Tourist Board. The trail follows a number of paths and abandoned tracks. In order to add research content to the trail, 20 information points have been erected, where most of the information about Dravograd's natural heritage can be found.Dr Branko Vreš, Rector of the Faculty of Biotechnics in Ljubljana, took care of this, while cultural and historical facts were written down by Marjan Kos, curator of the Koroška Regional Museum in Slovenj Gradec. <p/> The route is not difficult, it is suitable for everyone. It starts at the Health Centre in Dravograd, turns north on the steps and joins the local road Dravograd-Ojstrica at the direction sign at Poberžnik's house. It continues towards the Old Castle. The first stop is at the foresters' house, the Forsthaus, where foresters used to live and work. The house has been preserved in its original form and so has the tower, which catches our eye and had a special purpose. There used to be a nursery nearby, where you can read all about the cultivation of spruce, pine and larch seedlings. The trail then leads to the GradKuplen forest road. At the top, you will have a wonderful view of the town of Dravograd, its surroundings and the vast green forests. The castle shows its former grandeur with a remnant of the wall still standing. The castle was built in the first half of the 12th century, when Bernard of Spanheim became the owner of the Drava Valley. Over the centuries, the castle has changed hands, even being owned by the Counts of Celje and the Habsburgs, among others. North of the castle, a path leads to the ruins of the round court tower, where many a serf's life was extinguished. On the path below the Castle Bytown, a signpost soon directs you to the local Viltužnik-Mori road as you enter the forest. From there, you can see Libeliška gora and Strojna, as well as all three Dravograj bridges, the railway bridge and two road bridges. The view of the Dravograd Lake, created after the construction of the hydroelectric power station, is also extraordinary. The dammed area has developed into a marsh with reedbeds, which provides a rich habitat for many rare plants and animals, including some endangered ones. The lesser spotted bat and the rough bat live here, while the muskrat is common among the larger animals in the lake area. More than 150 species of birds are known to breed here, either permanently or occasionally, and swans are also regular visitors to the lake. <p/> The trail then leads on to the Dravograd-Vič national road, past the Dravograd hotel and petrol station, and winds along the path past the Sports Centre and the cemetery to the Fishermen's Home, where it approaches the River Drava. At Planšak, by the pier, there is a sign explaining the loading of sawn timber, the shayk, the ford and the harbour, and a little further on there is information about the history of the bridge and the bridge tolls. The ford used to cross the Drava only in Dravograd and Trbonyi. The St. Pauli serfs were exempted from the payment of the broadside, bridge and mitre fees, while the others had to give three sausages, cheese and ten eggs in addition to the broadside to be transported in the grain. However, since the ford was in the possession of the land lord of Dravograj, the fordsmen also had to pay her. The information board also tells you all about the smuggling of salt and more. From this westernmost point, the route follows a section of the trim track past a railway bridge that survived the bombing during the Second World War. The power station on the Fisherman's Path is not far from the bridge. It was built to meet the occupier's great demand for electricity and was one of the most modern in Europe at the time. The path then continues up the slope below the post office to the municipality and ends at the Dravograd Health Centre. <p/> Franc Heber, a general practitioner in Dravograd, recommends walking in his clinic, especially for orthopaedic and heart patients, and it has two main benefits: exercise and spiritual calming. Dr Heber told us about the path: ""The path is not too steep and not too long, it takes an hour and a half to walk it. This is the right time for the heart to reach the right frequency, 110 beats per minute. Walking is a great aerobic exercise, as oxygen is the best food for all parts of the body, from the supply of the brain to the heart. ""A walk along the Heart Path offers the freshness of nature and plenty of sunshine, and promises peace and tranquillity and an extraordinary view of Dravograd and its surroundings.

"Are you left without pressure in your heating system ? <p/> It has become uncomfortably cold in your home. This may be due to insufficient pressure in your system. In today's article you will find out all the possible causes and solutions. <p/> Insufficient pressure in the heating system is one of the most common causes of poor heating performance, and we receive the most calls from customers about it. <p/> Why is the pressure in your system too low? <p/> There can be several causes of low pressure. The most common causes are: <p/> Venting the system for too long: <p/> For radiators, we recommend venting before each heating season. Learn more about how to properly vent radiators. Often radiators are vented for too long, so only vent them for as long as air is coming out of them. Stop venting when water starts coming out. Venting for too long can cause a loss of pressure in your system. <p/> Safety valve too small: <p/> The safety valve protects your heating system from over-pressurisation. It opens above a certain value and starts to drain the water in your system. If the safety valve is too small, the valve will open too quickly and cause you to lose pressure in your system. This is why it is important to have a company with experience install your mechanical installations, many times boiler rooms are not sized correctly to achieve the lower prices offered on the market. <p/> Definitely the most common reason why the pressure in your system is too low. The expansion tank consists of two chambers separated by an impermeable membrane. One chamber contains the heating water - the other contains the gas, usually nitrogen. If the heating water expands as it is heated, the expansion tank regulates it: It absorbs the excess water and compresses the gas in the second chamber. If the gas pressure is incorrectly set or if the diaphragm is defective, the expansion tank will no longer work properly and the heating system will start to lose water. <p/> Water leaks from heating pipes, fittings, fittings and radiators: <p/> In rare cases, your system will leak water from a burst pipe, a fitting that is not tight enough, a radiator or even a fitting. Often the leak can be identified by puddles of water that appear at the very point where the water is escaping from the system. In the case of a burst pipe, for example, which is located under the plaster, the leak is more difficult to detect. Detection is aided by the use of a thermal imaging camera. <p/> For these reasons, it is even more important to choose a company with experience and references before deciding to install a heating system. This will ensure that you get a boiler room with quality and, of course, correctly sized materials. This will save you a lot of money and nerves :)",Information/Explanation

"8 comments <p/> Hehe, I see you had a lot of ""fun"" finding the right spoke. I'm curious to know how shit I'm going to be when the first one on my new bayko breaks. I have a wheelset Mavic Crossride with flat spokes :-) I have also noticed that they are mostly 2mm and I have also seen 2,2. But they usually come in silver or black. Last time I was shopping in a shop in Litija in LJ (I won't advertise) I even got black nipples for 2mm, but luckily they gave me one nipple over, because it turned out that one of them was without a thread :-) <p/> Yeah, you'll probably have a lot of fun with that too. I find it very sad, though. I have no words at all. At least for the bikes they sell, they could have stock for all models, even past ones. I couldn't choose the colour, although black would have been spot on as you can see from the video. <p/> In principle, they have spokes in all bike shops, if they have a bike service next door. If they have a spoke that is the same as yours is another question. If your spoke thickness is the classic 2.0 mm there should be no problem, you just need to find out the length. <p/> Hi David, if you have a cracked spoke on the gear side you will have to remove them. otherwise it won't be possible. Removing the gears is quite easy, but it is true that you need tools. You can see how to remove the gears in this video http://bikebook.si/2011/03/zadnje-pesto-shimano-xt/",Forum

"1,50 EUR <p/> Students <p/> 1,50 EUR <p/> Museum of Post and Telecommunications <p/> The renovated Museum of Post and Telecommunications, which operated in the Old Town Castle from 1985 to 2008, is now open in the Polhograje Manor House. The project is the result of many years of cooperation between the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia, Posta Slovenije, Telekom Slovenije and the Technical Museum of Slovenia. <p/> The Museum of Post and Telecommunications houses the renovated and expanded collections History of Post, History of Telecommunications, Women Telephone and Telegraph Operators and the Zhiva's Corner, which is intended for the youngest visitors. On this occasion, we also opened the temporary exhibition The beginnings of mobile telephony in Slovenia. <p/> The Postal History collection shows the development of the post office from prehistoric times to the present day. In four rooms, there are models of postal carriages, reconstructions of post offices and postmen's uniforms from different periods, as well as various means of postal transport (carriage, moped, bicycle). In addition to the above, you can watch excerpts from films on the theme of the post office and an animated film entitled Whose Letter Is It? The relocation of the museum has a special significance for the inhabitants of Polhov Gradec, as the post horn is returning to their town. It was once the property of the Tomšič family from Polhov Gradec, who had a lease on the post office in Polhov Gradec since 1869. <p/> The History of Telecommunications collection pays special attention to women telegraphists and telephonists. The development of telephony and telegraphy helped to create new jobs, which were filled mainly by women. Old telephone sets, teleprinters, telephoto machines and other devices for sending messages over distance are also on display. You can listen to how telephones were used in the past. Since December 2008, visitors can also see and try out the telephone and teleprinter exchange. <p/> The Animal Corner is aimed at the youngest visitors to the museum, who learn about the history of post and telecommunications in the children's corner through games (Find a Pair, Post through Time) and various workshops (making a post horn, a post cap, stamps, etc.).",Information/Explanation
"Even today - despite the strong influence of school and environment - what Jernej Pavlin wrote more than sixty years ago at the beginning of his story about today's Godovnjak is true: ""What children will ever be like depends most on their upbringing in the home. ""He adds, ""Holy parents sometimes have holy children. ""She is thinking of Brigitta of Sweden, the mystical wife and great saint whose daughter was St Catherine of Sweden, or Karin, whom the Church remembers today. <p/> Karin was the fourth of Brigitta's eight children. She was born in 1331 or 1332. She was put into a convent early on to be brought up. At her father's request, she married a pious nobleman when she was only fourteen. The young couple decided to imitate the virginal marriage of the Blessed Virgin and Saint Joseph. Catherine began to dress simply and without excessive jewellery. Her example was imitated by many young ladies, her friends. Her mother, Brigitta, went to Rome after her husband's death and lived a pious life there. Catherine's desire for Rome was also aroused. Her husband defended her at first, but finally gave her permission. Because of his illness, he was unable to accompany her. She came to Rome in 1349, when she was eighteen. She was happy to embrace her mother again. Soon, however, she felt very homesick and was about to return home. At her mother's request, she declared that she was ready to leave everything and stay in Rome for Christ's sake, but she soon came to despise Rome outright and asked her mother's permission to return to Sweden after all. Brigitta considered her daughter's wish a dangerous temptation, and she began to pray. Christ appeared to her and said, ""Tell your daughter that she is already a widow. Convince her to stay. I will take care of her. ""After a long time, Catherine found inner peace. Her mother's spiritual director also guided her, and under his guidance she progressed in virtue because she was obedient to him in everything. She made several pilgrimages with her mother, including one to the Holy Land in 1372. They both had a kind of monastic life, in which prayer, work, rest and charity were interspersed. Her mother Brigitta, in a vision, was ordered to found a new order with its first monastery in Vadstena, Sweden, as early as 1346. She also drew up the rules of the order, which is called the Order of Brigitta or the Order of the Saviour, but it was not until her daughter Catherine that her idea could be realised. <p/> Shortly after her return from the Holy Land, her mother died in Rome on 23 July 1373. According to her will, Catherine transported her body to Sweden, where it was solemnly buried in the monastery church in Vadstena. The nuns of this monastery lived according to the rules of her mother and elected Catherine as superior. But after only a year, she travelled to Rome to seek the leadership of the Catholic Church to have Brigitta declared a saint. She spent five years gathering the necessary material, then returned to Vadstena, where the bishop confirmed her as superior, and she began to prepare for her death: she died on 24 March 1381. Her canonization was confirmed by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484, and her mother Brigitta was declared a saint in 1391.",Information/Explanation

"Beans <p/> Related <p/> Superfood <p/> Historically, beans have actually been highly valued, but then important high-class chosen ones, such as Catherine de Medici, decided that beans were a peasant food that was not elegant and special enough for their stomachs. They replaced it with the trend of processed food, which is still not rooted today. <p/> Meat of the rich <p/> Hence the now-famous saying that beans are the poor man's meat, which is no longer true since experts believe that animal protein causes many diseases. For a while, beans were accused of not having as complete a protein composition as meat. It is true that it lacks two amino acids, but it is not difficult to compensate for them if beans are combined with foods that contain them, such as cereals. So you can pour bean sauce over couscous, and more recent findings show that it is not even necessary to consume this combination in the same meal - it is enough to consume all the amino acids in the same day. <p/> (Not) sophisticated? <p/> The reputation of beans as not being a sophisticated food is certainly due to the problems they occasionally cause. Many argue that if legumes are consumed regularly and in small quantities, they disappear. You may also find some of the natural recipes suitable. Look for dried kombu seaweed in health food shops. Add them to the water in which you soak the beans. The algae will not affect the taste of the beans and will almost disintegrate during cooking. Besides, there is nothing wrong with algae particles floating around on the plate. The more familiar bay leaf should have a similar effect, and some people recommend chewing half a teaspoon of aniseed immediately after a meal or at the onset of flatulence. <p/> Easy to prepare <p/> Although there are many types of beans, all of them, from broad beans to white or black beans, cook in a very similar way, just adjust the time to the size of the bean. Always remove any unusually shaped, discoloured or broken beans first. There must also be no holes, however small, in the beans, as they are invisible 'inhabitants' to our eyes. <p/> This will not happen if the beans are stored in a well-sealed ceramic or glass container. It can wait for a year, but do not mix old and new stocks, as the beans will then cook for different lengths of time. Salt, lemon juice, vinegar, wine or tomatoes should not be added before the end of cooking as they slow down the softening of the beans. <p/> Most IN <p/> Due to their easier digestibility, mung beans and adzuki beans have recently become the most popular types. Due to their smaller size, they only need to be soaked for a few hours and cooked for one hour. Season with turmeric, basil, thyme or coriander. Adzuki is known as the sweetest and least 'beany' type of bean. In Japan, where it is said to be native, it is used to make milk and desserts. Most often, the beans and sugar are boiled into a filling. <p/> Both types of bean can be ground into flour. They are highly recommended in Chinese medicine for women, especially during menstruation and lactation, and are said to strengthen the bladder and kidneys and to give courage and energy. <p/> Both types of beans can be sprouted, but mung beans are best known in this form: their sprouts are called soya beans. Interestingly, the sprouts contain vitamin C, which beans do not. To produce your own, soak the beans overnight and then place them in a suitable container in a warm, dark but airy place, making sure they are kept wet at all times. It is not recommended to eat the sprouts raw, so fry them in coconut fat and season them with soy sauce. According to Chinese medicine, mung beans are supposed to cool and detoxify the body, and to relieve inflammation. <p/> The basis of a healthy diet <p/> You can play around with soups, sauces, stews, spreads, purees and salads, but don't forget the spices. You can always add parsley, savory, sage or marjoram to beans. Add a little vinegar to your dishes to make them even tastier. In the end, beans will really prove to you that even a healthy dish can be tasty and cheap. <p/> VIVIN TIP <p/> Superfood <p/> If you soak beans in cold water and cook them very slowly, they retain virtually all their nutritional value. Beans contain zinc, iron, copper, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, manganese and selenium, as well as B vitamins. Folate lowers levels of homocysteine, the build-up of which in the walls of blood vessels causes the risk of cardiovascular disease. Fibre from beans helps to eliminate bad cholesterol from the body. Beans even contain substances that prevent certain cancers. It has a good effect on blood sugar due to its low glycaemic index and is also very beneficial for people with high blood pressure (with the exception of canned beans). And it can be eaten even if you are constipated. In addition, harmful substances from the environment do not get further than the pod.",Instruction

"WATERWELL IN RIHTAROVCI (RADENCI) <p/> Despite light rain, we inaugurated the restored village well in the centre of Rihtarovci in the municipality of Radenci - the 55th restored well within the Helios Fund for the Preservation of Clean Slovenian Waters - In 1999 Helios and the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning started restoring local wells in various forms of water sources - Rihtarovci is the 49th in the series of the Helios Fund for the Preservation of Clean Slovenian Waters. Rihtaštavlje is the 49th place in Slovenia where a water source has been restored with the financial assistance of Helios and the professional support of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning - After the blessing by the parish priest Janko Ivančič, the oldest villager, Terezie Mauko, was poured her first glass during the opening ceremony, with which she proudly toasted the gathered. <p/> In Rihtarovci, in the municipality of Radenci, the completely renovated village well was opened yesterday at noon with a short cultural programme by pupils from the Radenci Primary School and in the presence of many locals and guests. This spring, the municipality of Radenci applied for a call for funding, which for the tenth year has been organised by Helios and the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning as part of the campaign to preserve clean Slovenian waters. The village well in Rihtarovci convinced the expert selection committee and the renovation could soon start. <p/> The fountain is located in the central village area, in a small park next to a chapel with benches near the main road Radenci - Ljutomer. It is two kilometres from the centre of Radenci. It is a typical Styrian fountain, built more than a hundred years ago and equipped at that time with a large wooden wheel and a wooden shaft on which a supporting rope was wound with two wooden buckets rising up alternately. It is surrounded by a traditional wooden structure and the roof is made of brick tiles. It lies on a layer of clay up to 8 metres thick, which protects the groundwater from surface pollution and is 13 metres deep. The interior of the well was originally walled with sandstone, which was replaced by concrete channels 120 cm in diameter when it was rebuilt. Some parts have been modernised, but it remains essentially a copy of the decaying well. A submersible pump with a tap was added to facilitate the pumping of the water, and the original stone trough. The villagers used it until the construction of the village aqueduct The water in the well is in the self-purification phase and is not quite fit for drinking at the moment. <p/> The village well is also a popular walking route for guests of the nearby Radenci Spa, and will be of interest to thousands of annual hikers as part of the ""Three Hearts Marathon"". The fountain is also included in the conceptual design of the local water trail ""K stűdenci"", which was prepared by pupils of the Radenci Primary School and awarded a financial prize by the Helios Foundation. The pupils active in the project are working to make the trail a reality in the spring. It has also become a teaching point for the ECO Water System project, which is being developed by pupils from the local primary school. <p/> The restoration work on the well lasted from August to October and was carried out, also as a donation, by local companies and entrepreneurs and, of course, by the volunteer work of active villagers. The participants in the works were Viktor Zamuda, Emil Šmid, the Misja brothers, Branko Weindorfer Construction, Anton Kotnjek s.p., SGP Pomgrad, Tondach Slovenija d.o.o., Radenska d.d. and Boštjan Nedog Mizarstvo s.p. The value of the restoration work is estimated at 6,000 euros, of which the municipality of Radenci contributed 4,000 euros and the rest was provided by Helios through the Helios Fund. <p/> In the neighbouring municipality of Gornja Radgona, the Slatinski vrelec in Ivanjševci was restored in 2003 with the help of Helios, and in the municipality of St. George by the River Ščavnica, the school fountain in Stara Gora was restored in 2005 with the help of Helios.",News

"Television colloborations <p/> About a year and a half ago, Slovenia switched from analogue to digital TV reception. Quite a lot of people started to wonder what this would bring us and what it meant for our continued viewing of TV channels. The answer was very simple, because it was all due to the switchover to a newer technology, which, while it brings considerable improvements in terms of the picture and sound itself, before the switchover it was, in principle, more of a problem for the majority of the population. This difficulty meant either buying a converter or a new television that supports DVB-T. On this account, 2010 was quite a successful year for the sellers of this type of equipment, because monitoring programmes via an analogue signal was no longer possible afterwards, but I also think that both the Internet subs and the providers of other types of monitoring of TV channels were satisfied, because certainly not a few people opted for such a changeover. Eventually, the situation calmed down and it stopped being talked about, because things stood as they should. Well, yes, until it got complicated and a bit more serious. <p/> Earlier this year, Norkring ceased operating multiplex B (which they won the tender for), which contained TV3 and Pink Si, and the main purpose of the multiplex itself is to broadcast commercial programmes. Nevertheless, there were a number of other programmes that were licensed to be broadcast, but we did not see them during Norkring's management of multiplex B. Multiplex A, which is operated by Radio Television Slovenia, currently also broadcasts commercial programmes, even though it is intended only for national programmes. Thus, Slovenia has only one functioning multiplex, which contains both national and commercial programmes, and space for additional ones is running out. Since June, TV Slovenia's channels 1 and 2 have also been available in high definition (HD), but they can only be viewed by IPTV and cable TV users, and the switch to digital transmission has lost its significance, as HD viewing is not possible for viewers who watch the programmes via antennas. Instead, there are now four commercial channels in multiplex A, three of which - POP TV, Kanal A and Vaš kanal - have been there since the beginning, and were joined by Pink Si after the departure of Norkring. The multiplexes are now what they are, because the commercial channels will be in multiplex A until someone starts operating multiplex B again. This could be done again by Norkring or later after a public tender by someone else (source). <p/> On the other hand, there has been talk for some time of a new commercial programme, Planet TV, to be launched by Telekom, which would be quite different from the existing ones. Its content will consist of sports, films, serials and other programmes, and finally a news programme. It would be available via cable and IP television, and also via aerial reception (source). This is where the problem arises, because there are almost no more places in multiplex A, and the call for new channels was already published at the end of last October, with Golica TV, Sponka TV and TV Nakupi meeting the conditions. As the deadline (which is not legally binding) for issuing decisions is tomorrow, this could be delayed further, mainly due to pressure from Telekom, which did not apply for the tender within the October deadline (source). <p/> My view on all this is that, despite the pressure from Telekom, decisions should be issued to the programmes that applied for the tender in October and meet the conditions, and that once multiplex B has been given an administrator, the commercial programmes should go there and, if possible, TVS 1 and TVS 2 should start broadcasting in high definition in multiplex A. As for Planet TV, I hope that it will not be a copy of the current commercial programmes, whose main schedule is just commercials.",Opinion/Argumentation

"THE STRAGON STORY <p/> The image of Strygon is impressive, supernatural with traits of the divine, as if he were not of this world. Yet he is not beautiful, he is merely strange and frightening. His body is not entirely human, but bears distinct traits of anthropomorphism. He is a goat with human limbs and an upright posture. It has a goat's face with horns and a prominent hump that ends in a short, protruding tail. Some people still believe that whoever manages to touch its tail will be safe from all the scourges of life. His legs are of unequal length with large feet, which made it difficult for him to walk, and he limped and wheezed so that he could be heard from afar when he came. Because of his outward appearance, he was thought to be the devil, a demon that drinks blood. It was said that at night he would creep up on beautiful married women and sleep with them. Probably because he walked around half naked and liked to show off his possessions. Yes, they were even afraid of him because of his appearance and made up all sorts of stories about his evil deeds. But nothing was true... well, maybe if you took offence and didn't offer him good wine something could happen to you, but nothing fatal, you could get up in the morning feeling sick or with a headache. If you were so spellbound by Strygon you were treated with coals, a cup of water and prayers, and when you met him again it helped to 'hold your horns' in your pocket and spit gently sideways or roll up your trousers and turn at least one piece of underwear the wrong way round. Otherwise, he loved to help and use his magical skills to heal both humans and animals. And those whom he so helped liked to reward him with good wine, and he asked for nothing else. It seemed as if Strygon could not find his peace, and he roamed the villages of Istria, staging shrigonerias and looking for good wine. He helped some, he taught others, and he left a pleasant or unpleasant memory everywhere, depending, of course, on how he was received. Today, Strygon no longer walks around, and Istranians wonder where he ended up. Some miss him because he helped them, others are happy because they no longer have to fear him. But Štrigon has simply found his place in the sun in a wine bar in the middle of Portorož, where he can enjoy the company of good and cheerful people all the time, and above all, never run out of wine, as he did during his wanderings on the Šavrin hills. His eyes became sparkling, his heart full of goodness and his goblet full of the noble liquid. <p/> P.S.

"How to buy a phone <p/> A normal smartphone is the same in hardware as a computer from a few years ago. Because we always have it with us, it is a powerful productive tool that is always at our disposal. Computers have made us more efficient, why not smartphones? <p/> With hundreds of millions of smart devices and the same (if not less) productivity, the main question that arises is whether it might all be too much? We carry a games console, a web station, a music box, a mailbox, a navigation system and the list goes on. Too often, we choose a phone because it is overloaded with features, and we end up using only five per cent of the hardware and software. The situation is reminiscent of the power ratio in word processors, where Microsoft Word is still the leader, even though most of us use only a handful of bundled features that could easily be covered by any free alternative. As with tablets, the most important thing is to know what we want from a smartphone. <p/> Choosing a smartphone is, at first sight, very similar to deciding on a tablet companion. The operating systems are almost all the same, they have the same applications, advantages and disadvantages. In principle, there is no difference between a phone and a tablet. In addition, it is wise to have both devices in the same camp, so that we do not buy apps twice and do not catch ourselves while working with the user interface. Unfortunately, it turns out in practice that smartphone buyers do not make their choices based on hardware. When they buy, they often even overlook the attractive design and usability of the bundled apps, because the pace at which devices fly off the shelves is dictated by mobile operators, which is why sales figures for different phones vary so much from country to country. If the country's biggest mobile operator drops the price of the best Finnish Nokia model to one euro at the time of bundling, it will outperform, say, Samsung's champion overnight, even though the Korean sells like hotcakes around the world and nobody wants a Scandinavian Windows phone despite its excellence.",Opinion/Argumentation

"Source of the survey, which is also at the bottom of this article. Author of the column. Thirty years ago, his parents might have had a problem with this innocent childish line. If there is a cult of personality and the state is a proletarian dictatorship - and in the SFRY it was almost a constitutional principle that the proletariat was in power - then children in schools must not make a fool of the supreme authority. <p/> Indeed, until the end of the 1980s and the Slovenian constitutional amendments, Article 133 of the Penal Code, which criminalised freedom of conscience and expression, was also in force. The verbal offence meant that one was not allowed to speak over the state, the system and the leaders. The statement ""Comrade Tito has a fat arse"" would have caused problems with the authorities in the SFRY. <p/> For many people who are strangers to Slovenia's obsession with socialism and Titoism, it is inconceivable how, in 2012, so many sensible people can be fascinated by the figure of one of the typical dictators of the 20th century. Because twenty years ago, nobody thought about Josip Broz.In the late 1980s, when democratisation was beginning, you would have laughed at someone idolising a marshal or even dressing in similar uniforms. <p/> In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it did not occur to people to deplore Yugoslavia, Titoism or self-management. There were too many challenges, and faith in the future was strong. Interestingly, there was no noteworthy event at Dražgoše in that period either. Third-class officials spoke, a few hundred people gathered. <p/> At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, Titoism died out in Slovenia. <p/> Then something started to change at the beginning of the new millennium. Dražgoše suddenly took on a whole new glow and significance. They became a kind of value centre for an orthodox, pre-modern and quasi-partisan political rallying cry, aimed at mobilising the far-left electorate. In the light of historical facts, Dražgoše became Lažgoše. <p/> On a broader, social level, a reinterpretation of Titoism and history in Yugoslavia began to take place. Instead of historians shedding light on all the characters of the time - the only exception being Professor Jože Pirjevec's biography Tito and Comrades - and honestly saying that Slovenia had a semi-colonial attitude towards the southern fraternal republics (no, Slovenians will never admit that), an avalanche of amateurish interpretations of our heroic history took hold. <p/> Suddenly, we became the only nation to have preserved the tradition of Titoism. Only in Slovenia is the attitude towards Josip Broz markedly positive, and the memories of the SFRY bright and nostalgic. <p/> What is the reason for this, why is it so? <p/> Probably from our social pathology. Because other, much larger and more historic nations, which have the historical traumas of the 20th century, face similar problems in evaluating their psychopathic leaders - regardless of the degree of their autocracy. The Spanish, for example, with Franco. But Franco was at least as benevolent a dictator as our Tito. <p/>The Italians did not come clean with Mussolini. Partly because of a horribly incorrect education system which has not yet established the right degree of critical distance from the fascist period. <p/> The Russians are reviving the cult of the Georgian Stalin. They, too, have freaks dressing up in uniforms just like those worn by the Generalissimo with the moustache and going around, addressing people, appearing at obscure and less obscure events, pinching children's cheeks and saying that they are Stalin. <p/>Sick. But in societies that have not come clean about their traumas and fears, it happens. There is not such a big difference between Russia and Slovenia in this respect. <p/> The only reason Germans can't openly emulate Hitler (except right-wing extremists, whose political activities are largely banned) is because they have been sent through a process of denazification by their Western allies. The Austrians got away with it, hence Haider. <p/> There are more problems with the Slovenes. I have already written about this. The worse the present, the better the memories of the past. Since there can be no biological link with Titoism in the younger generations, institutionalised nostalgia for the old days is reinforced. This is no longer an innocent joke perpetrated by a certain Godnič. The revival of memories of the Day of Youth and the Titoist relay is a phenomenon per se. It is yet more proof of how lost, hopeless and pre-oedipal our 'liberal' and 'democratic' society is. <p/> So that there is no misunderstanding: the cult of Tito, of Franco or of Mussolini should be cultivated by people in peace in their own homes and, for my sake, in their cellars. In their private lives, they can do whatever they want. They cannot do it in public, or even within the framework of public institutions. <p/> Can you imagine if we had been lamenting Titoism in 1988 or 1992? Of course not. Only a few radicals did it then. Most Slovenians were happy to be out of the SFRY and out of the poverty of a failing country. <p/>Why, then, does it feel different today? Because of the economic and social situation? Certainly, the middle class is already or will soon be impoverished, more and more people are living on the poverty line, and in such a crisis situation it is understandable to recall times that most people no longer even remember, but are considered socially just (nobody went hungry, everybody was employed and similar wingnuts). But only in a society that is still a long way from maturity. Only in a country that is not aware of the foundations of its statehood. <p/> The idolatry of Titoism and the cult of personality is not irrational, as many people think. In my view, it all comes together in the context of Slovenian social pathology. We lived a relatively comfortable life materially and socially in the SFRY. The party elite in general. When the system collapsed because it was based on economically unsustainable assumptions, we decided to try capitalism. <p/> Capitalism has not worked very well in Slovenia. A friend of mine, who is a top workaholic and manager, says that the reason it has not is that the Slovenes have been 'Balkanised' by Yugoslavia and simply do not want to work any more. <p/> That is probably true to a certain extent. But the key problem of the hysteria about Tito and the Day of Youth can be identified very easily: as a country we have no identity, as a nation we have no will and no energy. <We really do not deserve a country of our own. And to paraphrase our beloved Titoists, Josip Broz would never have given it to us either. <Josip Broz symbolises socialist Yugoslavia after the Second World War: the reconstruction and construction of a war-torn country, socialist self-management, resistance to Stalin and the policy of non-alignment. It symbolises peace and full employment. On the other hand, it symbolises the cult of personality, the Naked Island, the beheading of liberals and the post-war killings. Under his leadership, Yugoslavia enjoyed great prestige in the world, and he will be remembered as an exceptional statesman. <p/> Špela Šipek, editor <p/> I think most people remember Tito as the figure of the commander who led the partisan army to victory over the fascist invaders and traitors. He symbolises the figure on the pedestal through which the PR machine promoted positive values such as comradeship, brotherhood, education, strengthening of mind and body. And, on the other hand, it symbolises the crime against those killed immediately after the end of the war and the persecuted political opponents. It thus symbolises the trauma of a part of the Slovene nation whose ancestors were killed or imprisoned, and of a part of the Slovene nation that is proud of its resistance against fascism. Although Josip Broz-Tito symbolises the past in its entirety, he also symbolises the division of the Slovenian nation, which is no less fervent now than it was twenty or sixty years ago. <p/> Janez Furman, parish priest <p/> Broz and Kardelj once came to the cross while walking along Brdo and looked up at Christ. Edi begins to explain how their lives were not always exemplary, yet they had come so far and this poor man had worked for the good of mankind and finally ended up on the cross. The marshal replies, ""Eddie, when we die, they will have no nails. ""And indeed, at the time of their deaths, you had a hard time coming up with nails. Before a critical historical distance can place Tito in the real context of his era, there will be spears being broken about his personality and his time in charge of the late SFRY. The abuse and the immature view of democracy have led many to associate the Marshal's figure as a mythical hero. Others who survived the Naked Island or any other repression would have erected a memorial to his sacrifice. Despite his glorification, we are all ordinary mortals together. <p/> Nina Ivanič, actress <p/> It is difficult for me to answer this question objectively, because as a primary school pupil I was constantly listening to and learning about Tito as someone who was all goodness, honesty, heart, ability and I could go on and on. In our childhood eyes, he was a great hero and a man with a big heart. That is what we were taught, that is what we believed. But there are two sides to every story, and so there are two sides to Tito's story. Over the years, many things have been revealed and all the glamour around Tito has slowly dissipated. In my adult eyes, he now symbolises something quite different from all of the above. Behind the pretty veneer, there is often an ugly and dirty side. <p/> Jure Apih, columnist <p/> There is not one Tito, there are many Tito's. He is the locksmith apprentice from Zagorje who learned to play the piano without any schooling, who won a medal in sabre fencing from the Austrian army and danced with the Queen of England on his island. He is a Bolshevik agent who mysteriously survived Stalin's purges. He is the leader and marshal of the only real resistance army in the Second World War. He is the war criminal responsible for the greatest indiscriminate slaughter of prisoners and civilians in Europe. He is the only leader who dared to stand up to Stalin and to lead his people on a third path between socialism and capitalism, between one-man rule and self-rule. He is the historic spiritual leader of a non-aligned world, of more than half of humanity, and his funeral brought together a crowd of world leaders like never before. He was a thistle and a ""sweetheart white"". Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo is the apprentice against him. <p/> Irena Prijovic, economist <p/> JBT symbolises the leader of Yugoslavia. What this symbol means to whom depends on the individual. It depends on which generation one belongs to, whether one is and how one lived at that time, whether one is a foreigner or someone who was once a Yugoslav. It depends on how history is summarised and interpreted. Personally, I associate Tito with a peaceful childhood, my own ignorance and the kind of illusion we were living at the time. <p/> I have just returned from Berlin and I am still under the impression of the symbols of the divisions of post-war Germany in that city. While the East Germans demolished the wall for a long time in various ways, and once it physically fell, we ourselves paid the highest possible price by fighting a war on the premises of the former state. <p/> Dr. Samo Rugelj, columnist <p/> It depends for whom. For some of the older generation, Tito is often still a symbol of the ""good old days"", when life was more carefree, albeit with a lower standard of living and political monogamy, but without existential fears. To my generation, Tito was a great leader who was forged into heroic heights for us with stories and songs, but personally he is best remembered for his illness, his treatment at the Clinical Centre and his magnificent funeral. I no longer had any special emotional relationship with him: when I spent a good year in Belgrade a few years later in the army, I was not drawn to the House of Flowers, even though Slovenians like to go there. For the younger generations, our children, Tito is a textbook historical figure who led Yugoslavia, or the SFRY, and they need to think hard to remember what that acronym even means.",Opinion/Argumentation

But to help them do this even better, and to boost their function and health, you can help them with certain foods. <p/> Vegetables help to rebuild the internal organs. (Photo: FreeDigitalPhotos.net) <p/> The liver is an organ that regenerates every 150 days. Old cells are replaced by new ones so that the liver can continue to perform its function. The heart also regenerates, as many studies have shown. This happens about four times during a lifetime. The skin regenerates faster, every 28 days, bones take ten years, the intestines regenerate every few days, etc. We can also help our organs to do even better, to regenerate faster and to stay healthy, by eating more food. Foods such as blueberries, green tea, carnosine (found in pork, lamb and fish) are good for the nervous system. These foods help to regenerate stem cells. Other foods that also have a beneficial effect on organ regeneration, especially liver and stem cell regeneration, are turmeric, celery, parsley, artichokes, royal jelly, coffee, red wine, black grapes, green tea. Foods recommended for faster renewal of insulin-producing beta cells are: black cumin, curcumin, vitamin D - found in fish, eggs, cheese, red meat, avocado, melon, chard, brassicas. Vitamin C is recommended for hormone regeneration. For heart muscle regeneration, the following foods are recommended: red wine, oatmeal, pork, poultry, young cheese, wheat germ. Curcumin is recommended for cartilage repair and for faster recovery from spinal cord injuries, while nettle, fish oil and other foods high in vitamin E are recommended for repairing diseased joints.",Information/Explanation
"Festival Speculum Artium 2019 and DigitalBigScreen 2019 <p/> 11th International Festival of New Media Culture <p/> The 11th edition of the festival will take place at the Trbovlje Workers' Centre from 17 to 19 October this year, with many guests from all over the world. <p/> Speculum Artiumpresents authors and projects at the intersection of art, science and technology. <p/> The Speculum Artium Festival of New Media Culture celebrated its tenth anniversary last year and has since established itself as the leading festival of its kind in Slovenia and a household name around the world. During its existence, it has hosted some of the leading names in high-tech, science and art, such as Hiroshi Ishiguro, Honda Robotics, Stelarc, Victoria Vesna, as well as local artists such as Robertina Šebjanič, Srečo Dragan and Laibach. <p/> The tenth anniversary was also an opportunity to take stock of the work done and to look to the future of the festival, which is one of only three of its kind that the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia recognises as being of high quality and renown, and for this reason also provides financial support for its implementation. In the spirit of the times and the development of both visual culture and technology, the festival's management decided to focus on virtual worlds and 3D environments. <p/> One of the flagship projects this year is the Brain Computer Hackathon, the first event of its kind in Slovenia. In addition, the Tree project, jointly developed by American artists Milica Zec and Winslow Porter, is also worth mentioning. The project uses new technologies and 3D environments for an engaging approach to a very topical issue, which environmental protection and climate change certainly are. Using 3D environments, haptic interfaces and sound effects, the artists put us in the position of a tree in a tropical rainforest. We can feel how the tree grows in its environment and how it is affected by climatic conditions. The project was presented at the World Economic Forum 2018 in Davos and attracted a lot of interest among the influencers gathered there. <p/> Also working with virtual worlds is British artist Nicola Plant, who will be presenting her project Parallax at the festival, which shares the thoughts of individual visitors in a virtual environment with all other visitors by sensing their movements and facial expressions, testing the possibilities of non-verbal communication between people in a world that is increasingly moving towards virtual reality. Borders in the digital environment are also being broken down by Bulgarian new media artist Ivan Petkov, who will present his installation My Country, Your Country, which allows visitors to draw the borders of real or fictional countries on the screen themselves, highlighting the fact that borders are in fact an artificial construct of the human mind and not something natural. <p/> While showcasing global productions, the festival does not neglect local new media artists. This year, among others, Saša Nemec, with the project Inside/Outside, and Boštjan Čadež, with the VR installation PD4, will be presented.",News

"Introducing UBI <p/> The idea of a universal basic income is decades old. It is interesting but lacks something to make it balanced. That is why I propose the introduction of a UNIVERSAL BASIC WAGE. <p/> I believe that every able-bodied citizen should work at least FOUR hours, <p/> -because in this way they would be contributing their share to society, as do those who have a job or other activity which pays for the running of the state. <p/> -because that would keep them in the ""game"". Much has been written about the problems of the unemployed. Including that over time they get used to vegetating in miserable conditions and re-employment terrifies them. So they would stay connected to work and people. <p/> -because it is right that everyone who is able to work should contribute as much as they can <p/> -because there are individuals who have built their own little world in which they parasitise on their parents, grandparents and friends. Parents do not resist them because of the guilt of having ""brought up"" such an individual, but also because they do not want to admit that they are part of the problem at home. Some individuals are also violent, which makes their parents give in. <p/> -because every individual has financial needs and, of course, spending needs, because they do not live on air. So he also has an income. Untaxed, of course. <p/> -because there are individuals who, although they work for nothing, do not contribute. Four hours of work a day would cause at least some to weigh up whether it might not be better to find other, declared work that better suits their needs <p/> -because it would make a universal basic income much fairer to those who are already in full-time employment <p/> -because there is enough work to go around. Our streets are overgrown, full of snow in winter and leaves in autumn. Many areas are untidy. Facades need painting, we need healthier foodstuffs, etc., etc., etc., etc. <p/> -because some of the work could be turned into businesses <p/> -because, until the introduction of a universal basic income, it would offer at least some income to those who are now without work and income <p/> -because no creature in nature survives that does not work for its existence.

"Last Friday and Saturday, as part of the Parallel Relicross, we brought eight aggressive drifters to Loga's Blagomix racing park to sweat it out in a direct fight against each other, which this year is reserved for the superfinalists of the 2007 Auto Magazin Drift Cup. It was a lot of action! <p/> The sly smile of Dusan Lukic let me know that this was going to be drifting action. The task was even more interesting: to find drifters who would knife each other. Why not, we are always up for action! A look at the AM Drift Cup overall standings after 2 events gave us a skeleton of the contenders, which we supplemented with a couple of individuals of our choice. And we didn't regret it. Neither did the competitors. The cars that complained the most were the ones that Cimerman, Zvan & Co. got to know each other a couple of times. But there was no great (and inseparable) ""love"", because fortunately it was mostly platonics that prevailed;)). . At the competition itself, it was a completely different story. Almost professional and synchronised glides with few mistakes and an enthusiastic audience. After the end of the show, the cry echoed several times.

"Every website needs hosting <p/> Creating a website absolutely needs hosting. This is the physical address where our website will live, so to speak. All of this takes place on the server where all the information that will be displayed on our website is located. This information can be in different sizes, shapes and formats - but it all adds up to the content of our site that we will show to the whole web. If you're new to web hosting, this article will introduce you to the most basic elements that are good to know. <p/> Table of Contents <p/> It all happens on the server <p/> First, let's take a look at what a server is. It's a powerful computer that has only one purpose - to host our website to which we connect via a domain. When buying web hosting we will have a few options to choose from. These options are: <p/> Server type <p/> Server capacity <p/> Server location <p/> Buying a domain <p/> If you are just starting out in business you may not be aware of all of the options listed above. We can get lost in all the different types of web hosting or server because we have never come across these concepts. It is important to realise that we need the right power and bandwidth of a hosting package to handle the traffic to our website. <p/> Different types of hosting <p/> Web hosting and servers come in many configurations. These configurations are made for different website profiles. The most common are: <p/> Shared hosting <p/> The most common way of running websites that do not need much power. In this case, the server hosts dozens or hundreds of different websites, all sharing the capacity of the server itself. This is most recommended for small webshops and projects where high power is not required. <p/> VPS hosting <p/> By far the most popular way of hosting websites. VPS hosting means that our website runs in a virtual environment. It is similar to shared hosting, except that we lease our own server capacity, but we don't share it with anyone. In addition, our files are completely secure because, although they are on the same system, they are physically separated from other users. <p/> Dedicated hosting <p/> Large companies and projects that have a lot of traffic need dedicated web hosting. Here, we lease an entire server for our use, putting all the power at our disposal. We don't share the server with anyone. <p/> Cloud hosting <p/> This is the newest type of web hosting, where multiple servers share the load of our website. This is recommended for the most demanding users who have huge daily website traffic.",Information/Explanation

"Where did the... domestic pasture go... <p/> Who doesn't remember the sweet sixties? A period of optimism, good humour and progress in all fields, every day. I'm thinking from a purely consumerist point of view, post festum of course, because like most of you I wasn't born yet. But with all these revivals and golden memories, I have utopically recalled that time when mass consumption went the other way. <p/> This time the Magdalene is a green square box, clumsily and naively designed for today, but interesting precisely because of this immediacy. The round title has mythological proportions and the black and white symbolic photograph shows nothing of sentimentality but the triumph of technology. However, since the scripture is not intended for design dogmas, I will abbreviate. Titania is the name of the product and it is a handmade macchino per pasta. <p/> My grandmother gave me this metal beast because she knows I like to cook. The seller's internal stamp shows that it was bought on 9 May 1968 in the shop 'La Casalinga' in Gorizia. Although I have never seen either my grandmother or my mother make pasta themselves - with or without a pasta maker - I have made one quite solid pasta from the first one. <p/> The process goes like this. First, the home-made dough is pushed through two rotating rollers, which roll the dough evenly into strips. Repeat the process, if necessary, with a narrower gap between the two rollers, depending on the type of pasta you want. Then pass the strips through the second spout, turn the crank and watch with glowing hearts the culinary miracle - noodles coming out the other side. Ugh, haute cuisine. <p/> Pasta is not exactly Slovenia's national dish and it arrived on the shelves relatively late. As I have gleaned from the web, the Mlinotest pasta factory was built in the late 1950s (proudly made since 1958). Housewives were stretching and drying simple noodles in their backyards long before that, since a product made of flour, eggs and water is a generic phenomenon rather than the alchemist's secret of a lodge of freebooters. <p/> If there is one product from our culinary treasure chest that is anti-potentine, it is the miller. They are made from rolled-out dough that has been baked in a whole piece in a bread oven, usually after baking bread. The baked dough was broken into larger pieces, soaked in water and thickened with whatever gravel was on hand. <p/> Since we don't usually have bread ovens at home, we can fascinate our invited guests with home-made pasta and hum a light Italian canzone as we turn the crank. Or spin a bouquet of evergreen Slovenian songs. Remember, we're in the sixties.",Opinion/Argumentation

"We women love make-up and we love to go to the chemist for a new eye shadow and spend a fraction of our salary on a new powder. But all that money can be thrown away if we don't use a proper, good quality brush that is designed for the task we are using it for. One look at the wide range of brushes on offer can be confusing for even the most skilled in the art of make-up artistry. So which brushes to choose? <p/> The quality of the brush depends on the quality of the bristles used. Although you might think that natural bristles are the best, this is often not the case. When buying natural brushes, we need to know what kind of hair they are. Often animals are even killed just for their hair. The best brushes are those made from hair that has only been shaved off, preferably the first time. The second clipping still leaves the top of the hair clipped and therefore sharp. Of course, you can also choose synthetic brushes, but these are mainly used for applying foundation and concealer. Artificial bristles harden over time, while natural bristles become softer. <p/> Foundation brush <p/> If you want velvety skin, invest in a good foundation brush. This will cover imperfections better and more accurately and, above all, when applying a liquid foundation, it will smoothly blend with sponges and fingers. <p/> Kabuki <p/> These little brushes are packed with bristles. They are perfect for applying mineral make-up. Make-up applied with these brushes is applied in thicker layers due to the large number of hairs in the brush. <p/> Concealer brush <p/> There are several types of concealer brushes, but they are usually a smaller version of the foundation brush, making it easier to apply concealer precisely to areas around the eyes, pimples and other imperfections. If you apply concealer with a brush, it will last longer than if you apply it with your fingers, as the latter way of applying the concealer mixes with the oil on your fingers. <p/> Fan brush <p/> Fan brushes are used when you want to apply a small amount of foundation - for example, on areas where your skin is oily and shiny. Because of its specific shape, we need to choose a brush that keeps its shape. <p/>Blush Brush <p/>This is a special brush that is used to precisely blend and highlight the cheekbones. It can also be used to sweep away bits of eye shadow that have fallen onto the face during application. The brush must be large enough to cover the entire part of the face to be shaded in one stroke.",Opinion/Argumentation

"How harmful is one cigarette? <p/> Doctors warn of dangers of a single cigarette <p/> Anyone who thinks that an occasional cigarette won't harm them is honestly mistaken. So-called ""social"" SMOKING and passive SMOKING, i.e. SMOKING where you inhale cigarette smoke from other smokers, can also be harmful to your health. These are as dangerous to the blood vessels, heart and lungs as regularly SMOKING several cigarettes a day. <p/> People tend to fear lung cancer when they smoke, which usually takes years to develop, but cigarette smoke starts poisoning our bodies with its 7,000+ chemicals as soon as we take our first ""smoke"". Damage is caused to the cells of almost every organ. ""That one smoke can be the cause of a heart attack,"" explains Regina M. Benjamin, a well-known American surgeon who advises people to avoid smoking, as well as second-hand smoke. <p/>A recent report on the impact of cigarettes and cigarette smoke says that any inhalation of cigarette smoke is harmful to health. Dr Terry Pechacek from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention warns of the dangers of passive smoking. Inhaled cigarette smoke immediately enters the bloodstream and changes its chemistry, making the blood more sticky and putting it at immediate risk of clots, especially if the person has a pre-existing blood vessel problem. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemicals, 43 of which are known carcinogens. There are also several toxins in the smoke, such as nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, ammonia, etc. Within six seconds of inhaling cigarette smoke, nicotine reaches the brain. In small amounts it acts as a stimulant, but in larger amounts it already interferes with brain function and affects the heart, blood vessels and hormones. <p/> L&M makers reveal cigarette ingredients <p/> An American tobacco company has revealed a long-kept secret about the ingredients in L&M cigarettes, which are also available on Slovenian shelves. The move by the Liggett Group follows efforts by the state of Massachusetts to require all manufacturers to disclose all cigarette ingredients on cigarette packs, which most tobacco factories have so far resisted. Liggett believes that every consumer has a right to know what they are buying. In addition to tobacco and water, L&M cigarettes contain high fructose corn syrup, sugar, natural and artificial liquorice flavour, menthol, artificial milk chocolate, valerian root extract, molasses and vanilla extract and cedarwood oil. There is also glycerol, propylene glycol, isovaleric acid, hexanoic acid and 3-methyl-pentanoic acid. Although tobacco companies send a list of the ingredients in cigarettes to the Department of Health and Human Services, government officials are not legally allowed to give out information on this. Sound like a conspiracy? <p/> Other dangerous ingredients in cigarettes <p/> For anyone who wants to quit smoking, the following list of ingredients already found in cigarettes by experts would no doubt help to sway the decision: <p/> Ammonia: an ingredient also found in some household cleaners <p/> Angelica root extract: causes cancer in animals <p/> Arsenic: an ingredient in rat poison <p/> Benzene: Used to make paint and synthetic rubber <p/> Carbon monoxide: poisonous gas <p/> Cadmium: contained in batteries <p/> Cyanide: deadly poison <p/> DDT: banned insecticide <p/> Formaldehyde: used to preserve dead animal specimens <p/> Naphthalene: an ingredient in mothballs <p/> Methyl isocyanate: a poisonous gas that killed eight thousand residents of Bhopal, India, in 1984.",Opinion/Argumentation
"The second man to climb all eight thousanders <p/> GL3 Post ID: 91944 <p/> Post ID: 39741 <p/> Diary of Jerzy Kukuczkà, a Pole <p/> WARSAW - The world's public has hardly known that another man has achieved a feat that only the famous South Tyrolean mountaineer Reinhold Messner has ever been able to match. Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland managed to do in ""just"" nine years what Messner took a total of 17 years to do: climb all fourteen of the world's eight-thousanders. <p/> Polish mountaineer Jerzy Kukuczka Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland is a true high-altitude mountaineer. He is a man who has left the beaten track, taken his own path, almost played with the eight-thousanders, and in the process opened up some new perspectives for mountaineering at such altitudes. ""On 18 September 1987, Jerzy Kukuczka was on the summit of the 8046-metre-high Shisha Pangma and confirmed Messner's ambition of ""one man on all eight thousand metres"" as the second man. Like Messner, Kukuczka, a trained electrical engineer, was trying to blaze new trails: not the usual expedition routes, but much more challenging routes, some of them even in winter! Do the two super-climbers - Messner completed his round of fourteen eight-thousanders just one year before his rival - see each other as rivals? ""I can understand the race for the most climbs, but not the race for the most eight-thousanders"", the South Tyrolean commented. Was that really an honest word? In any case, the Pole also stresses that he had no rival in sight in pursuit of his great mountaineering goal. He even seems to have unlimited respect for Messner's success: ""This man deserves all our respect; he was the first to climb all the eight-thousanders - some of them more than once"". Sympathetic words. Kukuczek started with Lotse (8516 metres) in 1979, followed by Mount Everest (8848 metres). In October 1981, he himself climbed Makalu (8463 metres). A year later, he climbed Broad Peak, and in the summer of 1983 he climbed Gasherbrum II and I. In 1985, he succeeded in Daulagiri (8167 metres) and Cho Oyu (8201 metres). Kukuczka's ninth eight-thousander was Nanga Parbat (8125 metres). ""Stations"" 10,11, and 12 were - all in 1986 - Kangchendzenga (8586 metres), K 2 (8611 metres) and Manaslu (8163 metres). Anapurna (8091 metres) was the next in February 1987. Lastly, as already mentioned, Shisha Pangma in September 1987. On the summit of this mountain, a Pole bivouacked, brought his skis and descended to base camp the next morning! Jerzy Kukuczka lives with his family - his wife and two young sons - in Katowice. He is considered to be rather shy, he does not want to be in the limelight, he does not like television cameras. He has made a reputation not only for his own climbs, but also as a leader of mountaineering expeditions. He has always tried to get as many climbers as possible to the highest peak. On Shisha Pangama, he was accompanied by Wanda Rutkiewicz, his compatriot, who is considered the most successful climber of the highest mountains.",News
"Description: Urban areas are characterised by high environmental pressures due to high population and economic development. In the past, these were the result of industrial plants and individual combustion plants, but now they are largely the result of increasing road traffic. A good understanding of the air pollution situation caused by traffic in the city is a prerequisite for designing effective environmental protection programmes and planning measures to reduce excessive concentrations of pollutants in the air. Emissions of pollutants from road traffic are difficult to measure and are therefore calculated on the basis of traffic data and vehicle category-specific emission factors. The methodologies used to control emissions from traffic differ in terms of input data, emission factors and the way emissions are calculated. Using the COPERT IV methodology, which is prescribed for national emissions reporting by the European Environment Agency but is less suitable for municipal reporting due to the difficulty of obtaining input data and the complexity of its application, we have determined emissions for the cities of Maribor and Celje. Based on the results of the COPERT methodology and data from the literature, we have developed a simplified methodology that requires less input data, is simple to use and at the same time efficient. Comparison of the results of the simplified methodology with the calculations of the COPERT IV methodology showed that the simplified methodology is suitable for estimating the total emissions of CO, NOx and PM10 pollutants from road traffic for the whole city of Maribor and smaller urban areas, and it is also suitable for estimating the CO, NOx and PM10 emissions from road traffic by vehicle category for urban areas with a number of registered vehicles above 20,000 and for estimating the total CO, NOx and PM10 emissions from road traffic for smaller Slovenian cities. Due to the expected changes in the structure of vehicles in cities, the simplified methodology should be reviewed and upgraded every three years Found in: keywords Summary of found:...

"I would like to know a couple of things about cat acne, if anyone has any more experience. mainly I know about the so called black dots under the chin, which are supposed to be cat acne or fungus? I know it can be done elsewhere on the body. <p/> I have seen the occasional spot on the chin in one of our cats, but now I have a different problem. fergie has these spots just under her nose, just on one side, and on her nose, mostly on the same side. around her nostril, if you can imagine. let me say that she eats quite stump-eating, and a lot of the time her nose helps with things, so it seems to me that this could be the cause of this outbreak around the nostril.... <p/> yesterday I cleaned that area with splivasept and water and it all went away under the snout, the skin was red there, today it's better... it's healing. there's one part on the snout that remains. instead of having a nice coat there, she has a small scab that doesn't come off with washing. of course I don't think to rub it too much, because it's extremely uncomfortable for her if I do that. <p/> I wonder if anyone has any advice on how to proceed? of course I can take her to the vet, that's not a problem... but I understandably try to avoid it if I can, because I don't want to upset the cat if I don't really have to. <p/> In my opinion it's just dirt, and when it dries it can stick so firmly to the skin that it's yikes. I just find it odd that it's so noticeable, because Fergie isn't white around the snot. I suggest just tapping the spot several times in a row with a soaked cotton wool, waiting a little each time, and then gently removing. A one-off treatment will almost certainly not get it all off, so keep repeating it, but preferably not on the same day, so that you forget the maca a little in between. <p/> yes, it's black up there, yes, I looked at it so close I could see it when you put your finger over it, but you can still feel that little spot. <p/> I think it will go slowly, yes, at least it hasn't gone back to where it was before <p/> When I still had temporaries, I used to dab their acne (even in the spot you described, it was usually) with colloidal silver on a cotton wool a couple of times a day...then the scab came off, peeled off and everything was ok underneath. <p/> u yeah, I didn't think of it right away, but it's good stuff! i'll try to get it now <p/> but otherwise it's pretty good! one little thing is still on the top of the snot, the rest looks good. i was actually thinking that there's a chance that they scratched each other and that's what caused the scab and the acne... what do i know. <p/> now I have another problem, because she scratched her ear too fergie doesn't scratch very gently, if she gets scratched she usually scratches it clean to the fullest, so she slaughters herself if she has to <p/> she gets rid of them for a couple of months. And they do it again. And then we repeat the treatment again and it's ok, until next time. They don't bother him, they don't hurt, they don't spread. They always appear on his chin. We haven't had more than 4 months of peace from them since he was caught. He is a special little guy who needs a little more ""maintenance"", he is just worth it. I don't care either, because I know what it is, but it's nothing terrible. Just acne.",Forum

"Beatification of the Drin Martyrs in Sarajevo <p/> 28 September 2011 at 10:11 <p/> On Saturday, 24 September 2011, five Drin Martyrs, religious of the Daughters of Divine Love, were beatified in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the ceremony, presided over by Card. Angelo Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, was attended by some 18,000 faithful. The faithful from Slovenia also made the pilgrimage to the beatification in 13 buses. Among the five new martyrs are two Slovene women from Dolenjska, Sr M. Krizina Bojanc and Sr M. Antonija Fabjan. <p/> The journey of the Daughters of Divine Love from Pal via Romagna to Goražde took four days and four nights. They arrived in Goražde on the afternoon of 15 December 1941. They were placed on the second floor of the barracks. That same evening, wild and drunken Chetniks broke into their room and tried to kill them. In defence of their human dignity and their promise of chastity, the sisters broke free from the hands of their attackers and jumped out of the window one by one. Meanwhile, the Chetniks broke down in front of the barracks and executed the severely wounded sisters with knives. They were dragged to the river Drina, which carried their bodies away a few days later. S.M. Berchmana stayed in Sjetlina for ten days, where she recovered quite well. Then she was to go to Goražde, to the other sisters, who were already dead. Two Chetniks took her away on a sledge. When he returned, the coachman said that she had arrived safely at her sisters' home. The attendant, however, had a rosary around her neck. It is recorded that she was killed on 23 December 1941. Sisters Jula, Berchmana, Krizina, Antonija and Bernadeta, known as the ""Drin Martyrs"", served God generously and with selfless love, as missionaries in the ""afflicted Bosnia"", especially by helping the poor. They confirmed their fidelity to God by shedding their blood. <p/> Word of their martyrdom spread far and wide. Therefore, on 4 December 1999, Cardinal Vinko Puljić, Archbishop of Vrbas, after having obtained the necessary permission from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, issued a decree to begin the diocesan process for their beatification. The beatification of the Servants of God Sr. M. Jule Ivanišević and the four sisters is not only an official recognition of their martyrdom, but also a high recognition of the spiritual values for which the sisters lived and sacrificed their lives. Jula Ivanišević, Berchmana Leidenix, Krizina Bojanc, Antonija Fabjan and Bernadeta Banja are witnesses to an extraordinary fidelity to God and an active love for the poor. In faith, we rightly hope that their shed blood will be the seed of new Christians who are aware and responsible, and of new spiritual vocations for new times. Martyrs are strong intercessors in every need, especially in the difficult trials and dangers of life. Many have already seen this. <p/> Blessed Sr. Marija Krizina Bojanc, baptised Jozefa, a nun and martyr, was born on 14 May 1885 in Šmarjeta, Dolenjska. At the age of 36, she entered the religious community of the Daughters of Divine Love in Sarajevo. Full of sisterly love, she was distinguished for her constant prayer, sacrifice and penitential life. During her lifetime she was called ""Sister of Prayer"". She crowned her life in fidelity to Christ when, on 15 December 1941, she gave her life rather than renounce her vows and Christ. Her martyr's blood is clear proof that she loved God more than she loved her own life. <p/> Blessed Sr. Marija Antonija Fabjan, also baptised Joseph, a nun and a martyr, was born on 23 January 1907 in Mali Lipje in the parish of Žužemberk. At the age of 22, she entered the religious community of the Daughters of Divine Love in Sarajevo and made her vows on 19 March 1932. She was distinguished for her simplicity, sincerity, piety and self-control. Faithful to her religious vocation, she was tortured and killed on 15 December 1941, together with four other sisters.

They are powered by Linux. <p/> The Top500, a website dedicated to keeping track of what's happening in supercomputing, has published its 53rd updated list of the world's most powerful computers. There are no changes to the top spots, with IBM's Summit and Sierra still at the top, followed by China's Sunway TaihuLight and Tianhe-2A, and Dell's Frontera in fifth place. Europe is represented in the top ten list with Switzerland's Piz Daint at number six and Germany's SuperMUC-NG, while France's Pangea III narrowly missed the top ten. <p/> All these supercomputers differ in terms of core count, floating point speed, power consumption and more, but they have one thing in common - they are all powered by Linux. <p/> Since Microsoft has taken away their right to use academic licences, the European Organization for Nuclear Research has decided to switch to open source solutions. <p/> For more than twenty years, CERN in Switzerland, or the European Organization for Nuclear Research as we call it, has been using Microsoft products under the licences that apply to academic institutions. These licences have to be renewed from time to time, and in March this year, when they wanted them again, Microsoft told them that such a licence was no longer valid for them and sent them the usual commercial contract, which more than doubled the price of the licences. CERN officials disagreed and revived the idea of switching to open source solutions. And the Microsoft Alternatives Project, or MAlt for short, was born. And what is the project all about? In their blog, they write that the aim of the project is to ""regain control of our own data"", and that it will start with the migration of mail services and Skype to open source alternatives, and if all goes to plan, all other services will follow. <p/> Microsoft must of course have reacted to the decision, because CERN is an extremely prestigious institution and therefore a nice reference. It offered a ten-year transition period during which the price of the licences would gradually increase, but the people in charge at CERN rejected the offer, saying that such costs were simply not sustainable. <p/> If the project is successful, the decision will certainly have wider implications. CERN is not the only institution of its kind to face what is known as vendor lock-in, or dependence on a single supplier. If they can show that essential services can be delivered without Microsoft and other providers of licensed software over which the user has no control, other similar institutions may decide to take a similar step.",News

"News <p/> At a discussion evening in Novo mesto, Roma assistants said that the scope of their work exceeds the stipulated 4 hours a day and that they no longer believe in the systematisation of this profession in schools with Roma pupils. <p/> On Friday, in the atrium of the Goga bookstore in Novo mesto, a discussion evening with Roma assistants took place on the education of Roma and the importance of Roma assistants. The event was organised by the Roma Association Gypsies Once Upon a Time - Roma Today and took place as part of the European Youth in Action project. Bogdan Miklič, President of the Association Gypsies Once Upon a Time - Roma Today, said about the project, entitled ""Centre for Media Research and Roma Coexistence"", that it comprises a collage of events that will take place all over Slovenia, in addition to Novo mesto, in Ribnica, the Kočevje region and another municipality. ""The project will include various workshops. Romani children will try out the role of journalists in Romani settlements, write short articles, and prepare short radio diary entries. The participants are young Roma, aged between 15 and 30, who come mainly from the Novometi region,"" Miklič explained. He added that they will appear in institutions that deal with Roma issues in one way or another. ""We will also meet with high school students, we want to appear in police buildings, various schools, to create a bridge between Roma and non-Roma, to breathe together, to find a common language and perhaps to break through prejudices,"" he stressed. <p/> Miljana Mikica Gligič, a Roma helper with many years of experience, said that a Roma helper has a very wide range of possibilities and does not have to be limited to primary school. <p/> ""If we were invited, we could also work in a social work centre, a municipality, a kindergarten, the state administration or the police,"" Gligič said. <p/> Lili Majer from Kočevje says she enjoys her work, but in the beginning she overcame her fear. ""I didn't know how I would be received by the pupils, their parents and the staff at the primary school, but I have no regrets about taking this job,"" she says. <p/> Mitja Novak works as a Roma assistant at the Frana Metelka Škocjan Primary School. He has many years of experience. ""At the beginning you feel responsibility and you have no feeling how you will be received. It took me three months to get used to it. I already knew the Roma parents and the children, but what worried me most was the reaction of the parents of the other children,"" he recalls. <p/> On Friday, we talked to Roma helpers about their work and Roma education. The discussion evening took place as part of the youth initiative of the Roma Media and Coexistence Research Centre, within the framework of the European Youth in Action project. Let's listen to a part of the discussion with the participation of Roma assistants Miljana Mikica Gligič, Lilica Majer and Mitja Novak. <p/> Ms Gligičeva explained that when she started this job, the condition for a Roma assistant was that he or she had a high school education and was familiar with Roma history and the Romani language, otherwise he or she could jump into the role of a non-Roma with the relevant knowledge. Subsequent applicants had to complete a 4-year course in Roma history and culture, mathematics, Slovenian and English. ""They have been awarded National Vocational Qualification Certificates, but apparently this counts for nothing, as there is a younger generation of Roma assistants who are being posted to schools directly from the Employment Service, even though they have not received the relevant training. Their contract does not say that they will work on teaching assistance, but on socialisation and integration of Roma,"" Gligic does not see how to mobilise Roma assistants in a different way. <p/> Novak adds that a condition for becoming a Roma assistant should be a certificate of national vocational qualification. ""The Ministry of Education has made this a condition for us to be able to continue to do this work, but things remain unresolved, even though it is the sixth year since we completed the training for Roma assistants,"" Novak notes. <p/> Mitja Novak believes that the Ministry of Education can provide answers in this regard, while Lilica Majer believes that the management of the People's University of Kočevje, which is the managing partner of the project ""Successful Integration of Roma into Education II"", which is developing and implementing the activities of the Roma assistant, would know more about this. Ms Miljana Mikica Gligič suggested that additional information be provided by Dr Vera Klopčič from the Institute for Ethnic Issues, who was present at the discussion evening. She stressed the great importance of the trust created by the work of the Roma assistants and the need to strengthen the links between the various stakeholders in society involved in the education of Roma. The participants agreed that it would be a good idea to organise an extended discussion evening with the participation of representatives of the Ministry of Education and other organisations.",News
"How many billions of euros are sticking out of our banking hole? <p/> Have we filled Slovenia's banking hole with too many billions? A billion too much is said to have been spent on the biggest bank alone <p/> If some economists, bankers and even forensic experts are to be believed, Slovenia's banking hole was actually too shallow for all the billions of taxpayers' money that have leaked into it. According to some estimates, a billion euros too much was spent on the rehabilitation of the largest bank alone. And all the mistakes in the bank bail-out are estimated to have cost at least a meagre three billion euros. Despite the European warnings, the banking hole will be open for domestic auditors to dig into. But only on a limited basis, as some documents will not be accessible to the domestic umbrella banks. The average citizen, who could have spent his or her investment in bank recovery on, say, a nice luxury exotic trip, will have to be content with these (limited) findings. <p/> The banking hole has been the subject of years of work by bankers, politicians, criminals and, last but not least, ordinary citizens. How could it not, since the last bailout of the banks in 2013 was so ""fat"" that it simply cannot be ""swallowed"". A good €3 billion cost taxpayers the last bank bailout four years ago. And it is precisely because of concerns and allegations that the whole bail-out was oversized by billions of euros that people want an epilogue to this story. Probably no one in Slovenia is counting on the kind of conclusion that the Icelanders have written in their banking story. This country of just over 300 000 inhabitants has become a model for the Western world in terms of how to prosecute criminal practices in the banking sector, with the imprisonment of 30 bankers and financiers who were responsible for the collapse of three banks in 2008. Time will have to tell how we will conclude the story at home. <p/> Where did the billions go? <p/> In 2013, many people believed that a big taxpayer bailout of the banks was really needed. Every last cent. This is what bankers, not just domestic bankers, but also European bankers, those from the European Central Bank, the central financial institution in the euro area, were convincing citizens. And if Boštjan Jazbec, Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, said at the time that ""Slovenian banks will be among the better capitalised in the euro area after the recapitalisation"", the laity could not doubt it. <p/> What actually happened? At the end of 2012, when speculations started to emerge that Slovenia would have to ask for international help because of the bad debts Slovenian banks had accumulated, the Parliament opened the door wider for the Bank of Slovenia to intervene in ailing banks with an amended Banking Act. Less than a year later, the Bank of Slovenia, together with the Ministry of Finance, ordered asset quality reviews and stress tests for NLB, NKBM and Abanka and, under special conditions, for Banka Celje, Gorenjska banka, Probanka, Factor banka, Unicredit banka ' Slovenija, Hypo Alpe Adria Bank and Raiffeisen banka. The quality review was carried out by Deloitte and EY and the stress tests by Oliver Wyman and Roland Berger. <p/> The estimates showed that the capital shortfall in the banks reviewed in the worst case scenario would be almost €5 billion and that €3 billion would be needed to recapitalise NLB, NKBM and Abanka. We taxpayers have ""paid for"" these, not only with taxpayers' money, but also by expropriating the holders of subordinated bonds and shares in the nationalised banks. Small shareholders - according to the Association of Small Shareholders, some 100,000 shareholders and 2,000 subordinated bondholders with €600 million in assets, some half a million savers in pension, management and insurance companies, as well as many companies and municipalities - protested and sought legal solutions. The Constitutional Court, even after responses from Europe, ruled that parts of the banking legislation that allowed for the forced deletion of qualifying liabilities did not contravene the Constitution and did not interfere with the right to private property. However, it is unconstitutional that the legislation failed to provide effective judicial protection to those affected. The Court therefore ordered the National Assembly to remedy the unconstitutionality within six months and ordered the suspension of the limitation period for claims for damages. <p/> Too much money in the banks <p/> Soon there were rumours that we had put too much money in the banks after all. Already two years ago, an unnamed Bank of Slovenia official told Finance that the data underlying the Bank of Slovenia's actions in the then nationalised banks were allegedly manipulated and the banks overcapitalised. Last year, a criminal investigation was launched in connection with the bank bail-outs, where the Bank of Slovenia, NLB and the auditing firms Ernst & Young and Deloitte came under scrutiny. The proposal for an investigation order published earlier this year, however, brought familiar accusations and arguments that have been coming from expropriated small shareholders and holders of subordinated liabilities since the banks were nationalised and rehabilitated at the end of 2013. The basic dilemma is, insofar as it is possible to understand the complex facts, that the picture of the banking portfolio was still positive in mid-2013, but that, after reassessments after only a few months, a deep banking hole had opened up, which is why, four years ago, we offered the banks a three-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion bail-out. That is to say, that the whole bank bail-out was tailor-made so that the holders of subordinated bonds lost everything in it. And that the capital shortfall in Slovenian banks could perhaps have been estimated much lower at the time. <p/> As reported in the Slovenian media, the Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, Boštjan Jazbec, the former Vice-Governors Stanislava Caprirola and Janez Fabijan, and Tomaž Čemažar of the Central Bank have been accused of abuse of official position. The prosecution's thesis was that they were aware that the reports on the state of the NLB were not made in accordance with the rules and on an acceptable basis, and therefore there was no legal basis for the extraordinary measures at the NLB.<p/> The fact that the size of the banking hole was oversized was confirmed to the DZ Commission of Inquiry by Andrej Hazabent, a former member of the Management Board of the NLB, who estimated that a billion too much money had been invested in the NLB alone.<p/> The Commission of Inquiry was also told that the size of the hole had been oversized. Among other things, he told the commission that NLB's operating profit was falling, ""so it comes from the unwinding of over-provisioning. If the transfer resulted in a loss of €500 million, the rehabilitation of NLB is estimated at €1.6 billion, a billion too much, when €1.1 billion is paid in"", he outlined. <p/> In the middle of last month, however, the newspaper Delo revealed a study by economist Veljko Bolet, who calculated that the banking hole was oversized by several billion euros. <p/>Obstacles from Europe <p/> The answers and facts about the banking hole will therefore have to wait. It remains to be seen whether the real numbers will ever crystallise. The public prosecutors immediately came under pressure for illegal activities in the collection of information in the banks. Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), protested last year about what he considered to be the illegal confiscation of information by the ECB. The ECB has also taken the matter to the Constitutional Court over the confiscation of its files in the context of the criminal investigation. The Bank of Slovenia has already lodged a constitutional complaint against the order itself. <p/> A few weeks ago, the European Commission decided to send Slovenia a first warning letter under the infringement procedure in relation to the seizure of ECB information in the context of a criminal investigation into the Bank of Slovenia in July last year. <p/> Meanwhile, the Slovenian government has decided to amend the Banking Act to allow the Court of Auditors to assess the efficiency and regularity of the Bank of Slovenia's operations and the decisions that led to the use of public funds. But to a limited extent. In particular, the State Auditors will not be allowed to audit the implementation of monetary policy, the application and interpretation of law and supervisory practices, and will not be allowed to interfere with the powers exercised by the Bank of Slovenia as an integral part of the European System of Central Banks. Nor will the Court of Auditors be able to impose corrective measures on the Bank of Slovenia or to call for the dismissal of the Governor. <p/> The Court of Auditors has already pointed out that in order to give an opinion on the Bank's operations, it needs to see all the documentation, and the Court of Auditors' first president, Tomaž Vesel, has even said that ""it is not appropriate for the Bank of Slovenia or the ECB, of which Sanka Slovenije is a part, to be able to decide which documentation should be reviewed and which should not be reviewed in a directional manner. However, strict restrictions on the timing of the public disclosure of the findings on these documents are understandable"". <p/> Since the amended law granting the Court of Auditors these powers is not due to enter into force until next year, the epilogue on the banking hole will probably have to wait for some time.",Opinion/Argumentation

"Polona Požgan Štorman, a graduate in political science and a graduate in history, is known to most people as the presenter of the morning programme on Radio Centre. She has been working at the radio for 16 years. She fell in love with it at the beginning of her student years, when she started working at Radio Student in Maribor. ""Everything related to speech and communication inspired me so much that I decided to make radio a part of my life. And it did,"" explains Polona, continuing, ""In all these years, I never thought about driving to work at 5am. Working in radio is a pleasure. Good company, good music, laughter, raving around the studio at the crack of dawn, morning coffees, sunrises, sometimes even a bit of a grumble, and I'm always pampered by my two radio men - Sašo Papp and Štefko Bratkovič. "" <p/> A committed radio personality, she is also a homemaker and enjoys cooking. Her favourite hobbies are cooking and baking. She has two very grateful eaters - her son and her husband. She loves cooking so much that she might be a professional chef if she were born again. ""Maybe I imagine myself in this role a little too much like Catherine Zeta Jones in No Reservations, but... why not? ! "" she remarks wryly. <p/> POLONA POŽGAN ŠTORMAN on her MAKS Of all her roles, Polona's favourite is that of a mother. ""If you were to ask Maks what he calls his mother, I would tell you that I call him 'love'. And that's the best word to describe our relationship. Max is my love and I adore him. He is three and a half years old and he is a boy like most others. He is mainly interested in toy cars, saws, lawnmowers, diggers and other motorised vehicles. I am not very good around them, so I involve him in other games, ones that are closer to me. We cook together almost every day. When he wakes up at the end of the week and sees that I am home, his first words are: ' Mum, let's go bake cakes now! ' What impresses me most is that Maks is a very happy child. He laughs and sings all day - of course he loves Taboo and knows all their songs by heart. When he gets serious and annoying, it's clear to me that something is wrong with him. He is a Leo, which means he is very stubborn. Sometimes it gives me grey hairs during this period, but I console myself with the fact that he will need this trait at some point in his life,"" Polona enthusiastically recounted. <p/> Polona's days are, in principle, meticulously planned. By Sunday evening at the latest, she knows what her schedule will be for the whole week. She gets up very early, her watch chimes at five minutes past four o'clock. ""If it rang exactly at four, I would think it was horrible, five past four is more normal,"" she explained with a laugh. She then works on the radio from five to eleven, then goes to the office or to lectures. Together with her friend Mojca Lubanjšek Pehant, she runs the school of rhetoric Retorik, d.o.o. No matter what she does or how much she works, she always has a maternal feeling inside her, which pushes her to work so intensively and so organised that she has enough time for her child. You would think that at this pace you would go to bed quickly, but that is not true for her at all, and it is true that she is in bed by 11 p.m. at the latest. <p/> Since she has had Max, her life has changed a lot, and for the better. Today, she wonders how she could ever say that she has no time or that she is sleepy. She wonders what she did before she had Max. Today, she feels that she has time for everything and does not need much sleep. Maks gives her energy in the afternoon or evening. The child never weighs her down, never tires her out, quite the opposite. <p/> She herself has never wondered what it is like to be a mother. She feels that she is a good mother. She and Primož were both very excited about Maks and when he came into the world they were mentally prepared for him. There were never any concerns, only some questions, and her mother, who used to be a midwife, solved them professionally. <p/> Every day when she comes home, Maks first plays and sings to her. ""Every day, really. He usually plays that it's Maco or Izi, they're the guitarists in the band Tabu, which his dad Primož is also part of,"" Polona told us. ""Now Maks is in the Good Fairy phase. He has a well-developed sense of humour and knows exactly how and with what to make people laugh. ""Sometimes he comes up to me with big eyes and asks me very seriously: 'Listen... are you my mummy?' He asks this because he knows that I will chase him around the flat. ""But she is happiest that he is healthy, and she tries to remind herself of that as often as possible. <p/> Primož likes Maks to be stubborn and to stick to his guns. ""I think it shows he has character,"" Polona laughs. So far, Maks has shown his true stubbornness two or three times by throwing himself on the floor and shouting, but otherwise he is very persistent. Polona is more strict, but she has often found that Primož is more of a logician when it comes to parenting. During her pregnancy, she ""devoured"" all the parenting books she could get her hands on, but she herself found that this was not the best. <p/> In the future, she wants Max to be healthy first, responsible second and independent third. If she can deduce by herself, these qualities bring happiness. But more importantly, she wants to instil in Max responsibility - for himself, for others, for work and for life. <p/> Maks has been playing with saws for two years now, and excavators and rollers and the like, and he is also moving into the Lego era. Towers are popular. But since the first year, the most used toy in his room is drums. His father, who is a drummer, bought them for his first birthday. For his third birthday he got new, more useful ones, but they are too loud for (Mum's) ears. That's why Maks now has headphones. ""He says they are green, which means they are red,"" Polona said laughing. <p/> Otherwise, the rules in their family are clear and every night Maks has a choice - either a cartoon or a game to play with Primož. During the day, cartoons and TV are not allowed. The exception is a Taboo video, which he sometimes wishes he could play drums or a children's guitar alongside. <p/> About early learning in kindergarten, Polona thinks: ""Everything in its own time. We don't have any extra-curricular activities for now. Maks still sometimes 'poops' his pants and it would be a bit funny if he was to learn English while doing that. "" <p/> Maks has been attending kindergarten since September. Polona was quite scared of going to kindergarten because he had been at home with a nanny for two years before that. But he has settled in beautifully. She is convinced that this is also thanks to the wonderful teachers, Petra and Martina. He loves them very much, he still talks about them at home. He now has friends at nursery and Primož, who drives him to nursery in the morning, says that he gets impatient if they take too long. Polona is grateful that in the first week of kindergarten they dispelled her doubts and showed her that her child is safe and happy with them.",Opinion/Argumentation

"It's like the Slovenian government without Dimitri Rupel, hehe. 1 I am writing this after watching yesterday's Trends. I stopped watching the show some time ago (mainly because of the lack of culture and unprofessional guests), but after a huge outpouring of black bile, I decided to watch it anyway to see where all the anger came from. Let me add my little finger to the debate for the time being. <p/> The point revolved around Michael Jarc, who wants to call a local referendum on the building of a mosque. I don't know the exact question (and, coyotes of journalism, they haven't published it anywhere - more proof of how much they care about the truth as long as it pops! ), but it seems to me that he doesn't want to completely block the building of a mosque, maybe just some minarets and/or accompanying sports facilities. This question has already been answered by the Constitutional Court, which ruled on a similar issue in 2004. At that time it stated: <p/> 35. From the foregoing it can be concluded that the objective pursued by the contested regulation is to restrict the right under Article 41(1) of the Constitution. However, such an objective is inadmissible in the light of Article 15(3) of the Constitution, according to which human rights may be restricted only for the sake of the rights of others (and in the cases provided for by this Constitution), because it is only for the purpose of restricting a right and not for the simultaneous protection of the rights of others. <p/> Therefore, paragraph 2 of the Decision calling the referendum is incompatible with the right to the free exercise of religion. Thus, the interference proves to be constitutionally impermissible already on the basis of an assessment under the so-called legitimacy test, and therefore the Constitutional Court did not need to engage in a further assessment of its excessiveness. <p/> So nothing will happen with the envisaged referendum. Although this did not stop Jelincic from (as always) starting a dispute 2 - although he then coldly told Becirovic to his face that he was a fool for equating him with Haider. The ever-noble Member is certainly as cunning as a pretzel, although the wiser ones are quick to overlook him. Once you have acquired some legal knowledge, he comes off as pathetic when he is clinging to the Slovenian Constitution and when he wants to lecture Mire Senica while the latter looks thoughtfully into the distance through the camera, inventing synonyms for his interlocutor in his head, without batting an eyelid. <p/> It seems to be popular lately for lawyers to engage pro bono only for cases that have the potential to be highly publicised in the media (Čeferin in Strojanovi PRESS) - lawyers are not allowed to (only) advertise. Andrej Saje also provided a newsflash bomb by saying that he wished the Islamic community all the best in the construction of their building, as he wanted everyone to have equal opportunities in terms of religion. OK, I guess we're not in the 14th century anymore and the Church has managed to civilise itself a bit and they're no longer impaling heretics on stakes or handing them over to the secular authorities to be cremated. But at least a little bit of rancour wouldn't hurt, no. At least a crude observation about the wrong God, pretty please? Well, it's not as if everyone is saying that the other side belongs to the wrong God and so, after taking all the creeds into account, we'll all be burned in Hell together. Or what? <p>Let us return to the mosque. As far as the morons have been and fallen out, everyone has one iota of a point. So, to combine them all into one (of) sentence. We definitely need a mosque. There is a good percentage of Muslims in Slovenia, and I do not see how it can benefit all of them to deny them a place to gather and a chance to practice their religion. We should not turn a blind eye - there are around 50 local places of worship in Slovenia, and the Orthodox faith also has its own church. The second issue is architectural. Very interestingly, Jelincic has pulled out a regulation from the naphthalene, which says that the building must be A metres away from the railway tracks 3. It must be appropriate to the surroundings or respect the architectural guidelines of the surroundings 4 As I am informed, the minaret is not compulsory, nor is the circular shape of the central building. I was also a bit disturbed by the picture showing a supposed mosque (although no tender/competition has yet been carried out), around which there is a hefty pile of sports and other facilities. It is true that they themselves know best what they need to carry out the precepts of their religion, and that even the Catholic Church has a house next door where ... er, well, yes ... religion takes place. However, the suggestion of tennis courts, a gym and a football pitch seems to me to be a bit of a stretch. After all, they (read the Arab Emirates) will be paying for everything themselves, so let them afford it if they can. <p/>After watching this, I'm not any more convinced that I'll start watching the Dren Dren Dren Dren Dren again, because they're on an even lower level than before. Uroš Slak really gives the impression that he only invites such guests autonomously for the sake of shouting, because when it flares up, he can't seem to extinguish it or turn the flow of the shouting conversation around. Apparently, they really cannot agree on anything or come to common conclusions, all that matters is the show, the shit and the stupidity. Anyway, I am in favour of the mosque (not exactly there and then and there, as they imagine in Trends, but let's wait for the actual tender) and I think that once it is built, there will finally be peace around this subject, which is being blown up to the proportions of a galaxy quite unnecessarily. So far, I have not seen anyone stoning a cuckolded man in an Orthodox church, or anyone burning down the home of a neighbour because he invites his friends to pray there. <p/> Or would you rather have a semi-stealing series called Brother to Brother, which costs EUR 1.5 million, and therefore we get True Reality cancelled because they cannot scratch together EUR 50 000? Although, somehow, it seems to me that this is more of an excuse to turn the national broadcaster into a brainwashing car wash, in the same way that it is now popular to lay off workers during a 'global crisis'. <p/> Anyway, every now and then I laugh at / marvel at the bizarreness of our professionals when they want to get into computing or the Internet - in today's case, it will be the legal profession. Sandra Cico, a lawyer, as a representative of the Association for the Protection of Audio-Visual Works, has sent the two sheets below to some (where is T-2, for example? ? ? ? ) Slovenian Internet access providers, demanding that they be blocked from accessing the torrent tracker PirateBay.org. It gives them 24 hours, then threatens them with legal and criminal proceedings. <p/> I understand the legal profession and the wishes of their clients, especially if one of them is about to receive a pile of money. However, this 'letter' is both legally and technically misguided. OK, they get the plaudits because they obviously know what an IP range is and what a tracker is, but for everything else I do not know whether to blame the ignorance of the law firm or the nepotism of Association 1. I would never dare to send such a request myself, even if local factors were very strong and very persistent. <p/> Banning the Internet, or parts of it, is ridiculous, impossible and slightly totalitarian. We all remember when udba.net hit - we streamed masses of scanned lists, searched there for our enemies and a few days later we were surprised by a fucking ""blackout"". Of course, the real geeks found themselves, and we grabbed some politically incorrect proxy and went back to the hilarious history of Danilo Potnik, Win Parachute and Ivan Janša. So the demand to ban a particular site is very ineffective, but it is also undemocratic - if memory serves, I pay for uninterrupted access to the entire web, if anyone has done anything illegal there, let them get on with it, leave the other users alone. <p/> The legal aspect can be problematic, especially because (as we are used to) the subject is not regulated with sufficient precision, let alone extensive case law. The requirement is interesting in its own way because it obliges Internet access providers to ban a site as if they had something to do with it (in Sweden, hello? ! ). The old Slovenian Penal Code knew a nice institution, cascading liability. It was really only for responsible editors, printers, etc., but we could follow that model. Of course, if the KZ-1 had not completely abolished cascading liability. Why? Well, the Minister's answer is as ""convincing"" as abolishing relative limitation periods. <p/> Liability on the Internet would go something like this: first, of course, the author, whose identification can become a whole project on the Internet, as there are plenty of tools for anonymisation. Second in line would be the webmaster. I'm not really talking about a webmaster per se, I'm thinking more of SiOL with its nest of blogs that anyone can open. If we couldn't get to that point, or if he was hiding in the Philippines, the domain owner would come into play, in very extreme cases of course. That is kind of where it all ends for my taste. It certainly ends with the Internet access providers, because, firstly, there is simply too much traffic for anyone to be able to monitor all their subscribers, and secondly, this requirement is absurd, because then, for example, all the providers in the world are responsible for the illegal streaming of copyright content via PirateBay, whose subscribers are, in a communist way, sharing games, music, programmes, porn amongst themselves. It is like the passengers on the trains in Madrid in 2004 suing the train company because a bomb was planted there by terrorists. The providers are just offering Internet access and there is no logic in having anything to do with something that someone creates and puts on a server at the other end of the Earth. <p/> Finally, a reflection for all the budding Slovenian pirates - THEIR responsibility in downloading illegal content from various trackers. Too many of them are brave, because so far there have been no serious / mass / high-profile police actions in Slovenia targeting anyone other than the traffickers, so they go around the forums shouting and beating their chests that nobody can do anything to them, while at the same time citing some EU directives and regulations. Let me disappoint you, oh, dear fellow-travellers. The Criminal Code (even the new one, strange that they have not abolished these things yet) knows about the infringement of copyright and other rights, which Sandra Cico already refers to - Articles 148 and 149 of the CC-1 are recommended reading. Add to that Article 38 - aiding and abetting (in the commission of a crime) and you have the perpetrator, streaming illegal content from the web. This applies to all ""ordinary"" pirates as well as to trackers (Filebits, Partis, Slobytes, etc.). This is really only a theoretical construct, and I cannot imagine Slovenian police officers and prosecutors looking at the troves of data on seized computers or 12 geeks sitting in court. After all, maybe we can look forward to live blogging, heh. <p/> As for these societies, it seems to me that we have quite a lot of them in Slovenia, although most of the time we don't hear anything intelligent from them, but it's more like air stirring. [ ] <p/> It is the title of a textbook on the Turkish invasions of Slovenian territory by Vasko Simoniti. And every time a multi-tourism kinastera comes to my mind, I start thinking about a topic related to culture. Today, I am going to get stuck into our beloved Slovenian language and spelling, or rather, into their squinting. <p/> Let's start with food. Hello. Olive oil. I have never heard a more butthurt word. Just as the oil itself became very fancy - almost art - when Jamie Oliver unhygienically poured it over arugula and parmesan. And it has also suddenly become artful to call it OIL. Let's go slowly: we know the tree that borders on the shrub, Olea europaea, that is, OLIVE. So, by induction, we find that the logical name for it is OLIVE fucking OIL. Mainly because it is the delicious olive that goes into the press, not just the tree - the olive. True, the SSKJ allows both terms, but olive is completely redundant. Especially since some SSKJ authors suggest the word crack for bun. Mhm. <p/>The other part, where there are untold problems, is the overlapping or, in the vernacular, umlauts. There are usually no peculiarities in the writing, except that the Council on Kanal A will apparently have to quickly upgrade the encoding to UTF-8 or change the font, because surnames with ü's are written as ue, although it is true that Slavoj Žižek is always left without a cross (above his head) abroad. It's the pronunciation that gets complicated. <p/> At the end of last year, we got a third President of the Republic, Danilo Türk, who won by a large margin. But even today there are some people (most of them in 24 hours on POP TV) who find it difficult to pucker their lips for the letter u and pronounce the letter i. All too often, however, they hear the disparaging Tirk; the unforgiving call him Turk (Zmago Padalec PRESS). Hans-Gert Pöttering, the current President of the European Parliament, is suffering a similar fate. He is most often rechristened Pottering or Petering. But it is the same, who would even bother! <p/> After a hard lesson, it is always good to relax / have fun, so take a look at how the new President Türk is perceived by the legends Ivan and Miro Serpentinšek, sorry, Serppentinschäck.",Opinion/Argumentation

"Slovenia: The famous Barcaffè magenta colour protected in Slovenia <p/> Atlantic Droga Kolinska has received a decision from the Office for the Protection of Intellectual Property (OIPP) to protect the Pantone 214C (magenta) colour, which has been used by Barcaffè for 50 years, on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia. <p/> Registering a colour as a trademark is a lengthy and demanding process, as the protection of a colour as a trademark grants the exclusive right to use it. <p/> Many conditions have to be fulfilled in order to be registered, one of which is that the consumer must associate a particular colour with the origin of the goods, i.e. the product. <p/> In a study carried out in cooperation with the Centre of Business Excellence of the Faculty of Economics of the University of Ljubljana, Atlantic Droga Kolinska obtained data showing conclusively that consumers associate Pantone 214 C with the origin of the goods, i.e. the Barcaffè brand. <p/> It was found that the highest proportion of consumers correctly recalled Barcaffè when seeing the magenta colour Pantone 214 C, 92.3%, which indicates a really high level of recognition among the public and is also extremely high when compared to brands at the tapestry level. <p/> All other conditions for the registration of Pantone 214 C as a trademark have also been met. <p/> Data show that in the EU last year, out of almost 154 000 registered trade marks, only 20 were protected as colour.

"How does Daddy come into being? <p/>Fatherhood and motherhood are two emotionally completely incomparable and irreplaceable roles, which no one can replace and which are unique. A wife can never make a husband a father unless he chooses to do so and develops fatherhood himself. <p/> Every adult man carries within him the potential to become a father. What is more, nature has equipped the child with everything he needs to communicate to his father and mother how each of them should take care of him. With its smallness, softness, smiles, shaky cries and amorous glances, it arouses in the adult woman an irresistible impulse to lift the child up in her arms and respond to it, and in the adult man a strong impulse to protect and defend this creature. And this is the very foundation of parenthood. <p/> The mother cannot replace the father and vice versa <p/> The child therefore receives a different kind of validation and a different sense of belonging and uniqueness from the father than from the mother. Which means that even a father who feels well for his children and is tender and motherly with them cannot replace the mother, just as a mother cannot replace the father, however determined, organised, physically active and proud she may be. Therefore, a father cannot learn fatherhood from his mother and vice versa. He has to find out for himself, with each child, how he can be the best father for that particular child at that particular time and in that particular family, what that particular child needs most from him, what he wants to express and what is in him but cannot get out of him. <p/> The father-child relationship <p/> The father-child relationship is established from a very early age and is important for both the child and the father. Children are strongly attached to their father from the very beginning. It is precisely because of the differences in the way the child interacts with each parent that fathers play a completely unique and crucial role in the child's socialisation. Fathers play with their children, stimulating them physically and mentally and guiding them towards new activities. Above all, they protect them! The ability to create a secure home is the cornerstone of fatherhood. <The child associates the father with new experiences, with spontaneity and with challenges. They easily become interested in such a father and a reciprocal relationship develops quickly in such circumstances. During the first three years, the father's sensitivity, cooperation and support during joint play are particularly important in the child's later perception of close relationships. His sensitivity during play gives the child a sense of respect and support, understanding the toddler's needs for exploration and contributing to a feeling of competence. Playing with a father who participates, who notices challenges and who encourages the child to challenge, solve and explore, the child develops a sense of importance, uniqueness, trust and belonging to his father. <p/> Daddy does things differently <p/> However, many times it is very difficult for dads to watch mummy looking after the child, finding herself and him feeling awkward and unable to build such a strong and warm bond with the child. He cannot imitate her, because he can never do something like a mother, because he is not a mother. But he can find his own way around her, which will be just as reassuring and just as interesting for the child. This means that he should learn to change in a way that is most pleasant for him and for the child, that he should calm down in a way that calms him, that he should play and have fun in a way that is also fun for him and that makes him feel that the child is comfortable around him and that he can be proud of his father. Fatherhood develops separately from motherhood, the only common point being the partnership relationship, which, if it is secure and confidential, eases a lot of pain, distress and insecurity because the partners can talk about it. <p/> Mothers, tell your man you need him! <p/> Men are far from immune to babies! They are just as vulnerable as they are. Men cry too, but with silence, withdrawal, ... out of a need to belong. A wife can tell her husband to hold the baby, to swaddle it. She can tell him that she needs him. What is more, she must make sure that she is always relaxed enough to be with the child, which means that she also needs his help to get dressed in peace, to eat her lunch in peace, to take a nap if she is exhausted. <p/> Every normal man and father is proud if he makes his wife happy, if he protects her and if his child loves him. Fathers are proud when they put their child to sleep, when they feel how important, beautiful, clever and interesting they are to the child. Husbands can therefore very well introduce children to their chores, to their world, because the child will be amazed by everything, the keys on the computer, the screwdriver, a piece of wood, a book, everything that Daddy does will be sacred to him. When Daddy shows the child what he is doing, what he is interested in, when the child is able to ""help"" him, it will be a great honour for the child, and the man will experience his chores in a completely different way. <p/> Contact with the child is important <p/> The basis of survival today is contact, emotional attunement. If parents cannot provide this for the child, it is a great deficit for the child. It is very difficult to live with such a deficit in the world, because he or she is not good at relationships. <p/> If the partner is afraid of contact with the child (for example, if he refuses to change the baby because he is afraid he will do something wrong), the child's mother is best helped if she can put a humorous spin on it, e.g. if she dares to confide that this father loves her child as much as she loves him. This is the only way that the baby's mother will be able to relax around the baby's father and the baby and live her motherhood to the full, not in bitterness and anger at the baby's father who ""chose not"" to take care of the baby for his own sake, not because she is so incompetent. <p/> Parenting is learned alongside the child and making mistakes is not necessarily a bad thing <p/> Do not be afraid if you do not know everything at the beginning, if you do not know your way around, if you feel helpless. The child has everything it needs to awaken the right response in the parents. A child's nature is made to ""teach"" parents. You can only become a mother and a father by your child's side from moment to moment, not in advance or with the help of a book. As the child develops, so you develop with him as a father and as a mother. That is why the first condition for this development is precisely physical presence. Even if the mother develops a strong contact with the child, the father will have to develop his contact with the child from the beginning, not from where the mother came from. <p/> It is not at all good for the child to have a mother and father who think that they have to do everything right and that they are doing as it says in the book, not as it is written in the concrete child. There is only so much contact with the child before the parents have to develop new ideas, new words, coaxing, comforting and playfulness around the child. The child likes parents who are distracted and learning on the fly, and it is best for the child if the parents acknowledge this helplessness and confusion and know for each other that they can only manage what is emerging on the fly. A child does not need ideal parents, but parents with whom he or she can observe how they invent, how they create, how they find their way. It is a very good feeling for a child to feel that his parents are developing alongside him, that they are changing alongside him, not that they were perfect to begin with, so it is up to him to adapt to them as quickly as possible. <p/> Talk and cooperate! <p/> It is important for the child that the father is happy, that he has a lot of energy, that he is glowing, that she can feel in his eyes that he is alive. This means that he needs to talk to his wife about his fears and insecurities, so that they can talk together, figure out how to move forward together. The ability to confront feelings, to find new solutions, to be flexible and creative develops most easily where a man and a woman are safe around each other and do not make excuses for each other. Then the child will call out for more and more discoveries and will continually reward both father and mother with its own development. This will make them each feel adequate, creative and content, which in turn will help them to be more connected and trusting towards each other. Then both of them will be able to be more and more sensitive, relaxed and loving around the baby, and their relationship with each other will grow ""unintentionally"". <p/> Fatherhood and motherhood develop most fully where a man and a woman are able to work together. A man can only become a father when he has developed his masculine identity to the point where he feels what the child needs from him as a man. In cases where the father does not decide to become a father and does not enter the family emotionally and actively, and consequently the mother takes over the whole parenting role and tries to emotionally take over and fill the father's role as well, it quickly happens that she also loses contact with the children. Fatherhood is the father's sole responsibility and motherhood the mother's sole responsibility. We cannot destroy each other's parenthood, but we can make each other so bitter that we do not even want to look for a parental role anymore. That is an injustice to the child. Parents deserve to feel fully each other's parenthood, but even more deserve to feel that the child loves them and that they are capable of loving the child too. <p/> So let mothers be mothers and fathers be fathers.",Opinion/Argumentation

"""Programmed Ambiance"" shows the relationship between cardboard, ambiance and numerical programming. The numerical structure is the basis of the whole art installation, on its basis the artwork produces itself. The programmed ambience consisted of 2184 drawings on cards, which were embedded in 156 hanging mobiles, the floor was covered by a carpet about 40 m long on which the numerical programme of one of the hanging card series was printed, and a horizontal grid structure that was attached just above the ceiling. The gallery hall was thus divided into three levels. The overall ambience was based on permutations of full and empty space, defined by a grid construction with 286 points - knots that measured out space to vertical mobiles. The numerical program that determined the position of the mobiles was selected on the basis of all possible 11-digit combinations of the characters 0 and 1, with the condition that they are in the ratio 5:6 and that the rows so selected follow each other in the original order, starting with the most uniform combination (1010101010101) until the given space is filled. Odd rows of the programme are read from left to right, even rows vice versa. The mobiles consisted of four card-programmed series entitled ""Ear"", ""Rifle"", ""Matches"" and a series entitled ""Day"", which was also featured as a comic strip in Problems -PU, an issue devoted to programmed art. Part of the ""Programmed Ambient"" installation was also a ""Programmed Carpet"" on which a partial numerical programme was displayed. Programmed Ambient was first exhibited at the Moderna galerija in Ljubljana in April 1969, as part of the Atelier 69 exhibition.

"By testing the more widely used and cheaper car models, you are to a large extent influencing people's perceptions of them. How do you view this? We don't want to shape people's opinions on a particular model, because they are not presented from the point of view of 'buy this model, not this one, where this one is roomier, cheaper', etc. In each article we therefore also include inserts that have no prominent role with a particular model, an example of this is when we dropped a piano on the bonnet of a Porsche to see if it could withstand the amount of pressure it was put under. The aim here is just to arouse interest or it is a humorous insert. The programme is there to entertain the viewer, not to form an opinion about a model or a brand. There are other shows for that. <p/> How many people are involved in the production of Tope Gear? Not many. There are something like 10 people in the production team. The rest, like the cameramen and the support team, are on loan from the BBC. <p/>How do you keep things fresh and viewership at the level it is? That's the job of producer Andy Wilmon, who comes in before the start of each season and explains out loud everything we need to change to be different to previous seasons. We (the presenters) are not different because we don't want to change, even though we know that people get tired of things very quickly nowadays. But they still haven't got bored of Top Gear, which is good. And this difference between all the actors on the show brings back a sufficient amount of freshness, constancy and also humour, which the audience appreciates. <p/> The Stig. (Photo: BBC) <p/> The mystery surrounding the Stig probably contributes to this. How important is it for the show that it doesn't find out who it is? The Stig's role is one of the most important in the show, because it really reflects what it means to be a petrol head, but at the same time it's the mystery around his identity that brings that ""appeal"" to the audience. But the Stig is a nameless and faceless character who simply has to remain who he is. He also has the role of test driver, which is a constant, because after Jeremy tests the car and glides through the corner, ""power"", and James scrutinises the details of the finish and soundproofing, while he drives the Bugatti Veyron down the catwalk, it is this car that drives the test circuit and gives a perspective of the power and "" perfomance "" of the car even in time. <p/> Why is it that we never see you and the other presenters driving the car around the track on time? We have deliberately left this role of driving on time to the Stig, with the supercars, and to the guests on the show, with the "" average "" Kia. And that's why it's important that the Stig always stays the same, that the times are comparable, and that the guests are only competing with each other, not with us, because that's not the purpose of this part of the show. <p/> Which one of you would be the fastest if you did a lap with a Kia? Yeah, that would be interesting, but certainly not Jeremy, because he'd be going in a straight line all the time, and James doesn't know where the accelerator is anyway (laughs). So me. If you were reincarnated as a car, which model would be Clarkson and which would be you? Jeremy definitely thinks it would be a Bugatti Veyron or, as a classic, a Lamborghini mivra, but I see it as a V8 Holden because it's a model with a big, loud engine that's fast on the straights and slow in the corners because of the tail tiling (laughs).

The lecture programme is financially supported by the Municipality of Celje. The lectures will focus on the protective factors of education that can help to prevent drug use. Drugs, both licit and illicit, are increasingly being used by children. The lectures will also provide parents with information on what behavioural and physical changes to look out for when they suspect that their child has used drugs. Although the topic is topical, shedding light on effective parenting skills and communicating with children in conflict situations in addition to addiction problems, only 160 parents attended last year's series of lectures in eight primary schools. This time, the organisers hope for a better response. The series of lectures will be delivered by experts in medicine, psychology, social work and criminology.",News

"Psychotherapy for the challenges of (in)fertility <p/> Reproduction is understood as a fundamental feature of life that allows the existence and continuation of the species. Parenthood is also a natural part of the life cycle and an important milestone in a partnership. Both are taken for granted, not as something we want from life, but simply expect. <p/> Infertility is often one of the most emotionally challenging and stressful life experiences that an individual and a couple can experience. The struggle to conceive or the decision to adopt a child can often be accompanied by feelings of loss, which are often difficult to share with friends and family. For women who are struggling to conceive, it can be extremely painful to watch a friend preparing to give birth or young mothers she meets on the street.

"Does algae generation mean the beginning of the end of your aquarium? <p/> Freshwater algae are a threat to aquatic life in aquariums. Algae are extremely tough when it comes to surviving and spreading throughout the aquarium tank, so you will need to be persistent to get rid of this problem. If you don't keep it under control, the aquarium will become a toxic water production system, which will be very harmful to your fish. You can prevent this by getting to know what is happening in your aquarium and what to do about it. With algae, it is best to prevent them from forming in the first place. This can be done by changing the water every week, as algae cannot thrive when there is new water in the aquarium, and by keeping up with other maintenance work. Some species of algae are edible, like much other marine vegetation, and are a food source in many parts of the world. There are hundreds of edible species containing vitamins and minerals. They are also used as fertiliser and food for livestock. In freshwater aquariums, there are quite a few species of algae that survive on nutrients in the water. In some cases, aquarium algae serve as food for aquarium inhabitants such as shrimps and snails, but if their growth is not controlled, they can be a threat to other aquarium life. Brown algae are often found in newly installed aquariums. They also thrive in poorly lit aquariums where phosphate levels are high and nitrogen levels are low. They are slimy and soft algae found on aquarium glass, in the substrate and in decorations. Brown algae will disappear in the presence of strong light, but may still remain in darker areas of the aquarium. In contrast, green algae thrive in aquariums with strong light. They appear as green spots on aquarium plants and on the aquarium glass. Hairy algae and filamentous algae appear as threads in the water. They thrive in aquariums if there is too much iron in the water. They are easily removed by wrapping a stick around them. Filamentous algae grow on the leaves of plants, are found at the tips of the leaves and can reach a length of 30 cm. Hairy algae usually grow at the base of plants, on the substrate and sometimes on the decoration. They are green-grey in colour and grow to about 4 cm. Most aquarists do not bother with this algae as some fish feed on it. However, freshwater shrimps such as Caridina Japonica feed on filamentous algae. A type of algae that enhances the look of an aquarium is the bearded algae. These algae form a carpet, usually covering rocks and plant leaves. They form closer to the light source. They are soft and slippery and grow quickly to a maximum of 3 cm. Bearded algae need a constant light source and are common in aquariums without plants and are quite difficult to remove by hand. By putting algae-eating fish in the water, you are constantly reducing the effect that algae can have on the aquarium. Fish such as Indian minnows, algae-eating foxtails and spotted armadillos are a great help in reducing them. Before introducing them to other fish in the aquarium, make sure they can be kept together in the aquarium, otherwise they will not do a good job of cleaning the algae. In small proportions, algae add colour and vitality to the aquarium. As well as providing food for some of the creatures in the aquarium, they can also provide shelter for small fish. They are also a good indicator of imbalances in the system. Algae show when there are too many nutrients in the water. Too many nutrients indicate that you may be feeding the fish too much and that some plants may be excreting nutrients. Algae can also indicate that you need to pay attention to the aquarium water, as it can be harmful to the fish and plants. The growth of freshwater algae depends on the existing conditions in the aquarium. Algae growth is dependent on three conditions: water, light and nutrients. Controlling these three sources is the main step in preventing them from growing and causing damage. Light can be controlled by placing the aquarium away from sunlight and artificial light should not be used for more than eight hours a day. Artificial light should not be too strong and it is a good idea to install an automatic timer switch. The feeding habits of fish vary from species to species. In order to control phosphate levels, which serve as food for algae, it is important not to overfeed the fish, as this will increase phosphate levels. If the fish have eaten and there are bits of food left in the aquarium, remove them immediately. In addition, regular water changes are important to prevent phosphate and nitrate levels from increasing. Change at least 10 to 15% of the water once a week and scrape off any algae clinging to the glass. Testing the water will also allow you to control algae build-up. Products to help you control algae: <p/> Amtra algenmaster - Works by damaging the algae metabolism and eliminating the formation of algal blooms <p/> Amtra system clean - An important product when changing the water.

"Change municipality <p/> For a healthier lifestyle and mental health <p/> New health promotion centre in Celje For a healthier lifestyle and mental health Interest in group workshops and individual counselling <p/> Celje, 28 September 2016 - The Together for Health project was implemented at the National Institute of Public Health in 2015 and 2016 with funding from the Norwegian Financial Mechanism. One of the results of the Together for Health project is a new health promotion centre in the Celje Health Centre and the health posts Štore and Vojnik-Dobrna. The centre is aimed at people who are at any risk due to lifestyle, chronic non-communicable diseases or mental health problems. It offers a wide range of free workshops and individual counselling on physical activity, healthy eating, risky drinking, smoking cessation, living with diabetes, relaxation and stress management, and coping with anxiety and depression. This year, from January to mid-September, more than 1600 individuals were involved in health promotion workshops and individual counselling in Celje, Štore, Vojnik and Dobrna. The oldest participant was 96 years old and the youngest 16 years old. <p/> All services are free of charge for the participants, as they are covered by their health insurance entitlements. At the Health Promotion Centre of the Celje Health Centre, participants receive professional support, relevant information and knowledge, and above all, they form attitudes, acquire skills and develop new behavioural patterns for a healthier lifestyle and mental health. Along the way, they can progress and empower themselves, eventually making some lasting changes in their lives in terms of giving up risky habits. And if they are already ill (for example, diabetics), they can live better with a chronic illness with the experience and knowledge from the workshops. ""We provide preventive check-ups in family medicine referral clinics for all adults over 30 years of age. We aim to detect risk factors for chronic non-communicable diseases (e.g. high cholesterol, high blood pressure, blood sugar, obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, risky alcohol consumption) early enough to prevent the onset of the disease. The Together for Health project has provided the Celje Health Centre with a Health Promotion Centre, where appropriately trained professionals provide group workshops and individual counselling to help adults change unhealthy lifestyle habits. We have focused on implementing a community-based approach, especially trying to reach vulnerable groups of the population and reduce inequalities in health care,"" said Dr Jana Govc Eržen, Head of the Expert Group for Prevention and Health Promotion at the Celje Health Centre, Coordinator of the Celje - Healthy City project and National Coordinator for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention. Marjana Iršič, Head of the Health Promotion Centre at Celje Health Centre, explained. At the Health Promotion Centre in Celje, we have noticed that we have attracted people's interest in our non-medication programmes. Compared to the previous organisation, the new work design also includes vulnerable groups of people in an organised way, for whom some health services were harder to access. As one of the innovations, we have also tested the cooperation with an intercultural mediator for the Albanian-speaking community in Celje."" Vulnerable groups in terms of accessibility to the health system and involvement in prevention programmes include the unemployed, precarious workers, migrants, homeless people, people who use illicit drugs, people with mental health problems, Roma, people with various disabilities and all others who face different barriers to taking care of their health. <p/> The results and benefits of the Together for Health project were presented by health experts and programme users on Wednesday 28 September at the National House in Celje. The new community-based integrative approach to health promotion and prevention was presented by. Alenka Obrul (Director of the Celje Health Care Centre), Dr Jana Govc Eržen (Head of the Prevention and Health Promotion Expert Group at the Celje Health Care Centre and National Coordinator for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention), Jožica Maučec Zakotnik (Head of the Centre for Management of Health Promotion and Prevention Programmes at the National Institute for Health Promotion and Health Care and Head of the Together for Health for Adults Project), Dr. Mgr. Polonca Truden Dobrin (Head of the Together for Health project for children and adolescents), Marjana Iršič (Head of the Health Promotion Centre at the Celje Health Centre), Nuša Konec Juričič (Head of the Non-Communicable Diseases Group at the Celje Regional Unit of the NIJZ), Alenka Rumbak (Director of the Celje Unit of the Employment Service), Martin Kač (Karitas), Suzi Kvas (Director of the Socio Health Care Centre). Stanislava Ferjanc (participant in the programme) and Vera Haliti (intercultural mediator) also presented their experiences. <p/> Users of the Celje Health Centre and the health stations of Štore and Vojnik-Dobrna therefore have the opportunity to take part in one of the three basic workshops: Healthy Living, Am I Fit and Relaxation Techniques. There are also modules on high blood sugar, high fats, type 2 diabetes and physical fitness. These workshops and modules are followed by a variety of in-depth sessions. Among the possible programmes are three in-depth psychoeducational workshops to support mental health: Coping with Stress, Support for Coping with Depression and Support for Coping with Anxiety. ""The workshops provide participants with information on the link between physical and mental functioning, why certain problems occur and what they can do to improve their own health. In a small group, they have the opportunity to share experiences and ask what they are interested in. Excessive or prolonged stress can lead to physical or mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to mental health that makes it harder for many people to seek help - but I think that is slowly changing too. More and more people are recognising the importance of getting information and skills for their own health,"" said Maruša Naglič, psychologist and psychoeducational workshop leader at the Centre for Health Promotion. <p/> Health Promotion Centres, like the one in Celje, are already operating in Sevnica and Vrhnika. In the Together for Health project, led by Jožica Maučec Zakotnik in the field of adult health, the National Institute for Public Health upgraded the existing health education centres both in terms of organisation and content. The approaches are designed to respond to people's needs, with a practical focus on empowerment for long-term lifestyle changes that can lead individuals to better health and well-being. The new design, based on community engagement and the coordinated mobilisation of a wide range of local partners, makes it possible to strengthen care for individual and public health, optimise the use of resources for health promotion and prevention, ensure the quality of staff and programmes, and improve health indicators for the future. The National Institute of Public Health stressed that the experience gained so far from the pilot programmes confirms the rationale for introducing health promotion centres in other health centres. Following the completion of the Together for Health project, the Health Promotion Centre in Celje is fully supported by the National Health Insurance Fund. <p/> *** <p/> Additional information.

"VARSTOR, JERNEJ ŠTORGELJ, s.p.from Rečice ob Savinji specialises in robotic welding. They also perform welding by other processes such as MIG welding and TIG welding. <p/> WELDING <p/> Welding is the process of joining two materials to form a single unit by means of heat or mechanical kneading. <p/> In welding, the heat source is an electric arc generated by the welding machine. The joining of materials is based on the temperature generated by the electric arc. This welding process is called arc welding. <p/> WELDING PROCEDURES <p/> MIG/MAG welding <p/> MIG/MAG welding involves the generation of an electric arc by means of a welding source. The arc is formed between the welding wire and the weldment. The arc joins the weldment and the filler material to form a weld joint or weld. <p/> During the actual welding process, the feeding device feeds the wire continuously through the torch to the welding site. Shielding gas is also added via the torch. <p/> MIG welding differs from MAG welding in the use of shielding gas. MIG welding uses an inert gas which does not react chemically with the welding consumable. MAG welding, on the other hand, uses an active gas which reacts chemically with the weld metal. <p/> Typically, the shielding gas contains active carbon dioxide or oxygen, which is why MAG welding is more common than MIG welding. <p/> TIG welding <p/> In TIG welding (Tugsten Inert Gas), an electric arc is created between the non-fusible tungsten electrode and the weld metal. An inert gas is used as a shielding gas which does not react with the weld. The most commonly used shielding gas in TIG welding is argon. <p/> In TIG welding, the addition of material is not always necessary. The joint between two weldments can also be made by welding their edges. If material is added, it must be added manually. For this reason, TIG welding sources are built differently from MIG/MAG sources. <p/> The different TIG methods include DC, AC and pulsed TIG welding. <p/> MANUAL WELDING <p/> Welding processes <p/> Welding processes are divided into several phases according to the degree of automation, namely. <p/> Semi-automatic welding - a specific working step is carried out automatically. One such welding method is MIG/MAG welding, where the welding wire is fed through the torch by a feeding device. <p/> In mechanised welding, some manipulative work is also done by machine, with the welder controlling the welding process. <p/> In automatic welding, the welding hardware performs the entire process independently of the preset programme. <p/> Robotic welding represents a very advanced welding mechanisation and automation. In robotic welding, a control system controls the movement of the torch and the manipulation of the welder. The robot can be programmed for different welding applications, so we are talking about the highest possible level of automation of the welding process. <p/> Robotic welding is most commonly used for products where the surfaces to be joined are curved and where several small welds in different directions are required. The reason for the purchase is not necessarily for mass production of products. Modern technologies allow for the increasing production of smaller batches of products. Individual parts have also been successfully produced in robotic workshops.",Information/Explanation
